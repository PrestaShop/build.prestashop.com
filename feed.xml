          <description>As we move into March, let’s take a moment to review the progress made in February across the project. While PrestaShop 8.0.2 and 8.1 are certainly two key priorities, a lot of work has also been put in on other aspects of the project. Nonetheless, the final touches for PrestaShop 8.0.2 are currently underway, and progress on PrestaShop 8.1 continues to move forward steadily. Additionally, several exciting new features have been merged that will be incorporated into PrestaShop 9.0.</description>
