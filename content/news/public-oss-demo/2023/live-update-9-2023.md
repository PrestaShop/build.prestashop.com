The project's live update was held for the ninth time this year and [streamed live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNAfcQhVmVM) on October 11th, 2023.

## PrestaShop Live Update - October 2023

It was a special Live Update where we said goodbye to the project leader, [Pablo Borowicz](https://github.com/eternoendless), who, after over six years, is leaving the PrestaShop company. On behalf of everyone in the project, I would like to thank him for all the work he has done for the project and wish him all the best in his future endeavors.
