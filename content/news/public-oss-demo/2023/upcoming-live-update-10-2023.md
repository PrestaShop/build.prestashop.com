The tenth Live Update for the PrestaShop Project will happen on **Wednesday, December 20th, 2023** at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_20_Dec_2023_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7CQ2Sg-v4XQ)!

This time, we will announce project updates and follow two presentations originally given at the PrestaShop Developer Conference in Paris:

- PrestaShop news - where we are and where we're going by [@matks](https://github.com/matks)
- API OAuth/CQRS in PrestaShop 9 by [@jolelievre](https://github.com/jolelievre)

Remember that at the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions during the presentation or beforehand.
**If you have questions related to the open source project**, feel free to let us know in advance [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will do our best to answer them during the Q&A session.

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!
