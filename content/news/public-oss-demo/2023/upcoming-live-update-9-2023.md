The ninth Live Update for the PrestaShop Project will happen on **Wednesday, October 11th, 2023** at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_11_Oct_2023_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tNAfcQhVmVM)!

We will go over the latest project updates, take a look at recent changes in the software, changes made in the developer documentation and at the end of the session we'll have a special announcement to make.
