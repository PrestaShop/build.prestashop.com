The next Live Update for the PrestaShop Project in 2024 will happen on **Wednesday, November 27th, 2024** at [4pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_27_Nov_2024_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tLgjG8nYe4&ab_channel=PrestaShopProject)!

We promised to bring you presentations from the PrestaShop Developer Conference 2024, and we are keeping our word!

One of the highlights of this upcoming Live Update will be the presentation titled **"Long live Update Assistant!"** by members of the Seamless Upgrade & Extensibility team. This presentation, originally showcased at the PrestaShop Developer Conference 2024, has been highly anticipated by the community. It will be a great opportunity to learn more about the developments in the [autoupgrade](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) module, and to see how the *Update Assistant* will help you update your PrestaShop store to the latest version in the future.

Make sure to mark your calendars and join us for this exciting event!

Remember that at the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions during the presentation or beforehand.
**If you have questions related to the open source project**, feel free to let us know in advance [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will do our best to answer them during the Q&A session.

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!
