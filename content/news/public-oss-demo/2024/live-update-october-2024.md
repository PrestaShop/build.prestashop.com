On October 30th, 2024, we hosted another Live Update for the PrestaShop Project with the latest news, announcements, and some insights into the project's future.

## PrestaShop Live Update - October 2024

During this Live Update, I presented the latest news about the project, including the release of PrestaShop 8.2, progress on PrestaShop 9, and changes in the PrestaShop developer documentation.

I also talked about the [PrestaShop Developer Conference agenda](https://events.prestashop.com/prestashop-developer-conference/en/sessions) and introduced you to the [PrestaShop Project Newsletter]({{< relref "/news/posts/2024/introducing-prestashop-project-newsletter" >}}), a new initiative we launched recently.

It was over an hour of speaking about the project and the future of PrestaShop. You can watch the replay on YouTube:
