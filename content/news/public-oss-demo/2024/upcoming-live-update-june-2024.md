The next Live Update for the PrestaShop Project in 2024 will happen on **Wednesday, June 19th, 2024** at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_19_Jun_2024_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeVNLHY1Onc)!

We will present an overview of the recently released PrestaShop 9 Alpha. This session will cover some of the new features and improvements introduced in this latest version.

Additionally, the Seamless Upgrade & Extensibility team from PrestaShop SA will join us to share their latest projects, with a focus on the recent improvements to the [autoupgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade). This segment will introduce a new team that handles a set of solutions and guidelines designed to facilitate PrestaShop Core, Modules, and Themes upgrades.

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.
