On June 19th, 2024, we hosted the fifth Live Update of the year. We had the opportunity to talk about PrestaShop 9 and get to know the team working on, among other things, the PrestaShop autoupgrade module.

## PrestaShop Live Update - June 2024

During this Live Update, we had the opportunity to meet the Seamless Upgrade & Extensibility team, who are actively involved in various projects within the PrestaShop ecosystem. One of their key focuses is the development of the PrestaShop [autoupgrade](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) module, which plays a crucial role in system upgrades. The team shared their recent achievements, discussed their vision, and addressed challenges. At the end of the Live Update, we had a Q&A session where we addressed questions from the community.
