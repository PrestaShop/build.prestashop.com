On June 20th, 2024, we hosted the fifth Live Update of the year. We had the opportunity to talk about PrestaShop 9 and get to know the team that is working on, among other things, the PrestaShop autoupgrade module.

## PrestaShop Live Update - June 2024

This Live Update was a great opportunity to meet the Seamless Upgrade & Extensibility team. They are working on the PrestaShop [autoupgrade](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) module and upgrades in general, which is a key component of the PrestaShop ecosystem. The team shared their latest wins, vision, and challenges. We also had a Q&A session where we answered questions from the community.
