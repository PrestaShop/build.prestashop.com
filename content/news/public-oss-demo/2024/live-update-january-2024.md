## PrestaShop Live Update - January 2024

The first Live Update in 2024 was a chance to show the community yet another presentation from [PrestaShop Developer Conference]({{< relref "/news/posts/2023/prestashop-developer-conference-2023" >}}), present new patch versions, and answer some questions about the project organization, branding, and the future.

For those who are interested in slides from Łukasz Janik's presentation, he will write a blog post about it soon. We will share it with you as soon as it is ready.
