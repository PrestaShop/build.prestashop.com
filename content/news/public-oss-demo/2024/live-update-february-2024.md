The project's live update was held the second time in 2024. Read on for a recap of the session.

## PrestaShop Live Update - February 2024

The second live update in 2024 was held on February 7th, 2024. During the session, we had two presentations.

[Fabien Vallon](https://github.com/fabienvallon), Lead Product Manager at [PrestaShop](https://www.prestashop.com), provided an exciting glimpse into the upcoming Core Upgrade application. This tool, set to be released later this year, promises to streamline the PrestaShop upgrade process, and we can't wait to share more details with you.

[Tomas Ilginis](https://github.com/tomas862), a developer from [Invertus](https://invertus.eu/en/), shared his experiences working with PrestaShop modules during the live update. His insights, drawn from his work at one of the leading agencies specializing in PrestaShop, provided valuable perspectives.
