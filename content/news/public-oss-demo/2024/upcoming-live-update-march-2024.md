The third Live Update for the PrestaShop Project in 2024 will happen on **Wednesday, March 13th, 2024** at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_13_Mar_2024_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=097fUWgPuWo)!

In the upcoming Live Update, we turn our attention to PrestaShop 9, a version yet to be released. We'll explore the significant breaking changes introduced in this new version. [@M0rgan01](https://github.com/M0rgan01) will specifically address the backward incompatible changes due to the new Symfony Framework version, changes that are especially relevant for module developers using the Symfony Framework in their solutions.

This session is the first in a series aimed at detailing the changes in PrestaShop 9 and their impact on the development of modules and themes.

Remember that at the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions during the presentation or beforehand.
**If you have questions related to the open source project**, feel free to let us know in advance [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will do our best to answer them during the Q&A session.

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!
