It's been a while but the next Live Update for the PrestaShop Project in 2024 will be back on **Wednesday, October 30th, 2024** at [4pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_30_Oct_2024_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfQzUWhQJCE)!

In the upcoming Live Update, we will provide updates on the latest developments in the PrestaShop Project, including PrestaShop 8.2, version 9 and more. It will also be a great occasion to discuss the PrestaShop Developer Conference 2024 in detail and tell you more about our plans for the future.

Remember that at the end of every meeting, there is a Q&A session. You can ask your questions during the presentation or beforehand.
**If you have questions related to the open source project**, feel free to let us know in advance [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will do our best to answer them during the Q&A session.

The session will be kept in record on YouTube, so even if you can't attend the live stream, you will still be able to catch up later.

See you then!
