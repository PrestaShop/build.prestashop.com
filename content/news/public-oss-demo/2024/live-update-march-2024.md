In our third Live Update this year, we reviewed the already implemented compatibility of PrestaShop with Symfony Framework 6.4, focusing on its impact and the backward incompatible changes it introduces.

## PrestaShop Live Update - March 2024

In our third Live Update of the year, [Morgan Pichat](https://github.com/M0rgan01), one of the core developers at PrestaShop SA, delivered a presentation showing some of the details and challenges regarding the integration of Symfony 6.4 into PrestaShop 9.

Morgan highlighted some of the significant changes for solution authors in the PrestaShop ecosystem following the upgrade and the challenges overcome during this project. Congratulations to Morgan and the rest of the core developers team for their exceptional work on this project üéâüëè.

We will document all these changes in our developer documentation, providing a comprehensive resource for our developer community. This update is part of a series where we show impactful changes coming to PrestaShop 9.

## Friends of Presta Day 2024

During the Live Update, we also announced the Friends of Presta Day 2024, a two-day event held on April 2nd, 2024, in Marseille. FOP Days, organized by the Friends of Presta association, is an excellent opportunity to meet and share experiences with other community members in France. To learn more about the event, visit the [Friends of Presta website](https://friendsofpresta.org/friends-of-presta-day-fop-day/).
