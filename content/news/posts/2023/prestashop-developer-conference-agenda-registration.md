If you're a PrestaShop developer or enthusiast looking to broaden your knowledge and connect with fellow community members, the [PrestaShop Developer Conference](https://events.prestashop.com/prestashop-developer-conference/en) is the event for you. 

Scheduled for November 30, 2023, in Paris, France, the conference promises an in-depth exploration of technical topics, innovative solutions, and ample opportunities to network and engage with peers who share your passion for PrestaShop. We're also very happy to go over the recent unveiling of the agenda, packed with compelling sessions and engaging activities.

## What exactly is the PrestaShop Developer Conference?

The PrestaShop Developer Conference is a gathering focused on supporting the PrestaShop developer community. It caters to both seasoned experts and newcomers, offering opportunities for knowledge sharing, networking, and gaining insights into PrestaShop. Additionally, the event serves as an informative platform for those interested in contributing to the open source community.

The [conference agenda is now available](https://events.prestashop.com/prestashop-developer-conference/en/sessions) on the website with talks about solutions for developers, performance, security, new features and CI/CD.
But now, we’ll be going in a bit more detail about the program. So you can have a better overview of the day and understand what will happen, who will be speaking.

There will be two rooms at the venue: the main stage and the tech  room. The main stage hosts a few more people than the tech room. But the main difference is that the tech room has a mix of shorter and longer talks, allowing for attendees to get a good mix of knowledge throughout the day.
