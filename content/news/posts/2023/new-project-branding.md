This week will see some changes with the Project. PrestaShop SA, the company, is making the open source Project consistent with the new PrestaShop branding. 

## New PrestaShop Project branding

Unveiled earlier this year, PrestaShop launched its new brand identity to affirm PrestaShop’s strengths, showing more credibility and trust.

Therefore, in the next few days, to align with this new identity, all materials related to the Project will change. You’ll see the rebranded Project’s website, developer documentation, this blog, and other Project-related content.

We understand you might have questions regarding this rebranding. We would love to listen to them in the comment section of this article.
