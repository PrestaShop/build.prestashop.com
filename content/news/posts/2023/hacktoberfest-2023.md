The month of October is coming quickly! So be prepared for Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open source software.

## Hacktoberfest 2023

The online event has been happening every October since 2013 and is sponsored by [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). This year marks the 10th anniversary of the event, with changes to help ensure its sustainability for the next decade. You’ll learn about these right below. How can you participate? Very simple: people are encouraged to create at least 4 pull requests for open source projects on GitHub. Hopefully, you'll take some time to contribute to PrestaShop.

If you are not sure how to get involved in open source projects and where to start, Hacktoberfest might be the perfect opportunity.

## Getting involved and contributor prizes

Your goal is to contribute with at least 4 quality pull requests to the open source project you like. DigitalOcean will send every contributor achieving this goal prizes. As mentioned earlier, the change for this year is the prize. The organization will [offer an exclusive digital reward kit](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#digital-rewards). Winners will receive unique badges featuring surprises and gifts from sponsors.
Another change comes from the planted tree: one will be purchased for the first 50,000 participants that complete their first PR/MR.

Everyone is welcome, especially beginners. No matter what your experience, you can participate in Hacktoberfest. Just find the open source projects you want to be involved in and start contributing! It is a simple process:

:wave: Register for Hacktoberfest first, [right here](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/register), starting on September 26.

:computer: Create pull requests to get involved in your favorite projects - they must have a public GitHub repository.

:white_check_mark: Make sure your pull requests will be validated by Hacktoberfest: [check the rules](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#pr-mr-details).

:bulb: Remember to let the open source project know you are participating in the event. You can put information in your Pull Request’s description.

:busts_in_silhouette: Wait for project members to review your contributions.

:repeat: Go through this same process to achieve the goal of 4 pull requests!
