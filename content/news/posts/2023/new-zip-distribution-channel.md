As we continue to evolve and adapt to the global e-commerce landscape, we are implementing changes to streamline our operations and enhance our projectâ€™s trajectory. In 2022, we aimed to make PrestaShop a company-neutral open source project. Today, while keeping the project neutral, we are changing how we distribute the PrestaShop solution, starting with the upcoming 9.0 release.

## One release, one Zip

As you know, versions are distributed as two separate Zips, one on GitHub and a later one on prestashop.com, leading to confusion within the ecosystem. From now on, we are simplifying how new versions of PrestaShop are released with a single Zip build. 

Future versions, starting with PrestaShop 9.0, will be available in one unified Zip available to download on PrestaShop.com, eliminating discrepancies and following one release schedule.

This strategic change is the culmination of extensive feedback and careful consideration. It aims to:

1. Streamline communication: We're simplifying the release process, thereby reducing confusion across the ecosystem.
2. Centralize issue reporting: By having a single release channel, bug tracking becomes more straightforward, accelerating our responsiveness and efficiency in handling issues.
3. Synchronize releases: Aligning release dates ensures all users access the latest features and security updates simultaneously, without the complications of staggered schedules.
4. Optimize testing processes: Consolidating to one release means fewer tests are duplicated, which enhances our quality assurance and speeds up development cycles.

While this approach adjusts how we manage the project, we remain eager to maintain and enrich our relationship with the community. We believe this direction will improve our offerings and strengthen our future prospects, and we look forward to your continued support as we progress together.

The single Zip will be hosted on [PrestaShop.com](https://prestashop.com/prestashop-offers/classic/), and the **[freedom to build and customize your own distribution](https://www.prestashop-project.org/maintainers-guide/processes/release/prestashop/create-build/#6-build-the-zip-archive)** and PrestaShop's open source status remains unchanged.

**Open Source is and will remain in PrestaShop's DNA.**

We understand that questions might arise from this change. While we do not have all the answers today, we are committed to transparency and would like to address your questions during our upcoming [Live Update session on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeVNLHY1Onc&ab_channel=PrestaShopProject) on June 19, 2024, at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_19_Jun_2024_in_Paris).

If you have questions, feel free to let us know in advance [using this form](https://forms.gle/FWazuZnXBtFPauFZ7). We will do our best to answer them during the Q&A session.


**Important note:**

This article has been updated on May 29, 2024, to precise that the single Zip distribution will be only for the upcoming PrestaShop 9.0 release and future versions. It is not retroactive to previous versions, e.g., PrestaShop 8.1.
