### PrestaShop 8.1 is out!

You read that right! The new PrestaShop 8.1 is out! ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations to the whole PrestaShop project team, contributors and community members who made this release possible. Version 8.1 is a minor upgrade, with major improvements. The all-new product management page, full support for WebP and Avif and lots of other improvements are waiting for you. Read about this in the [release notes]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-1-0-available" >}}).

With the release of PrestaShop 8.1, the development of PrestaShop 8.0.x has been stopped. The 8.0.x branch will not be updated anymore and existing fixes will be moved to version 8.1.1. Branch 8.1.x will be used for handling upcoming patch versions for PrestaShop 8.1. If you want to know more, the project's website contains all the details about the [PrestaShop release cycle](https://www.prestashop-project.org/project-organization/release-cycle/).

If you want to upgrade to PrestaShop 8.1, the new version of the [PrestaShop Upgrade Module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases) is available.

Important note: if you upgrade from a previous version, the new product management page will not be enabled by default. You need to enable it in Advanced Parameters -> New & Experimental Features -> New product page.

### PrestaShop Developer Conference

The first-ever PrestaShop Developer Conference is coming! On November 30th, 2023, in Paris, we will have a full day of technical talks about PrestaShop. This conference is a great opportunity to meet the PrestaShop project team and community members.

You can read more details and register on the conference [website](https://events.prestashop.com/prestashop-developer-conference/en). The call for papers is open until September 29th, 2023. If you want to share your knowledge about PrestaShop, don't hesitate to submit your talk!

### PrestaShop 9.0 is coming

Things are not slowing down in the PrestaShop project. The development of PrestaShop 9.0 is in full swing. Some new features and improvements are already available in the `develop` branch. The [dev version](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop) is already based on Symfony 5.4 and PHP 8.1, which is a great opportunity to improve the codebase and make it more modern.

#### RectorPHP in PrestaShop

Thanks to [@FabienPapet](https://github.com/FabienPapet), the core is already getting some improvements and getting them quickly!

[His contribution with RectorPHP](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32945) helps to refactor some of the code to use all the new features from PHP 8.1.

#### Symfony 5.4 related changes

Upgrade to the Symfony 5.4 also required some changes in the codebase. For one, Swift Mailer [has been replaced](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32736) with Symfony Mailer, some [unused Symfony libraries have been removed](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32943) and some libraries that were forked in the past have been [replaced with the original ones](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32872).

#### PHP 8.2 compatibility

Thanks to [@Progi1984](https://github.com/Progi1984) the version 9.0 is now [compatible with PHP 8.2](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/29116). You can read more about the changes in this PHP version on the [php.net website](https://www.php.net/releases/8.2/en.php). As dynamic properties are now deprecated, I'm sure there will be some work for module developers in the PrestaShop ecosystem.

#### Codebase cleanup

The major version is also a great moment to clean the code from deprecations or some unused features that were supposed to be removed in the past. One example is a [generation of HighDPI images removed from the core](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32446), as it is no longer helpful. You can use the `<picture>` tag with the srcset attribute to load images depending on the screen resolution. 

The same goes for the "Disable/Enable module for mobile devices feature". It has been [removed from the core](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/31151) since we believe there are ways to achieve the same result with the help of different means. It also caused some troubles with Smarty cache not being differentiated between devices.

There are also some examples of removed deprecations, like [`Tab::getClassName()`](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32161) or quite a significant change with `Tools::displayPrice` and `Tools::displayNumber` removed. You can check the details in this [pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32164).

#### New features

New versions are not only about removing and cleaning up things. Some new features are already available in the `develop` branch. One is the [debug mode enabled only if the specific cookie exists](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32809). This is the first part to make this feature more secure and explicitly available for those needing it. There's also ongoing work on the Symfony migration. More and more pages are being migrated to Symfony, like the [features page](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32334), and some others are in the works.

### Hummingbird theme

The Hummingbird theme is [getting some nice improvements](https://github.com/PrestaShop/hummingbird/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged) recently! You should definitely check the [theme's repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/hummingbird) to see latest developments. Thanks to the help from the Theme&Design squad from the PrestaShop company we are getting closer to the first stable release of the theme.

If you are interested in using Hummingbird in the future, it is time to start testing it and reporting issues. You can do it [here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/hummingbird/issues). You may also want to contribute to the theme. You can find more information about it in the [contributing guide](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/contribute/contribute-pull-requests/).

The theme is still in the development phase, so it is not recommended to use it on production websites.

### Changes in modules

There are some minor changes in the native modules. You can review them all in the list on the bottom of the page. A lot of modules have been updated by our new committer [@leemyongpakvn](https://github.com/@leemyongpakvn). He changed the build part, so that new versions use build script from the organization. This should make them easier to maintain them in the future.

As PrestaShop 8.1 is now available, we took some time to test the [example modules](https://github.com/PrestaShop/example-modules) against this version. If you work with PrestaShop, this repository is a great starting point to understand the current architecture and some of the latest features of the software.

### Developer documentation

The developer documentation is getting more and more new content and improvements. The [PrestaShop DevDocs](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/) is a great place to start if you want to learn more about PrestaShop development. It contains information about the PrestaShop core, how it works, how to contribute to the project, how to create a module or a theme and much more. The documentation is open source, so if you find any issues or want to contribute, you can do it on [GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs). 

In June, a few changes have been made. We upgraded to the new version of Mermaid, which is used to generate diagrams in the documentation. We also improved canonical link for the "List of hooks" page, so if you search for it in Google, you will be pointed (hopefully!) to the correct page. We also improved a button visible if you browse documentation for older versions of PrestaShop, now it should be more visible.

![Button informing about the docs for new version being available](/assets/images/2023/07/docs-old-version-button.png)

Content-wise, some new things have been added to the [PrestaShop 8.1 Notable Changes page](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/modules/core-updates/8.1/). We recommend checking it out if you want to know more about the changes in the latest version of PrestaShop.

We also managed to merge some bigger improvements in the sections below:
- [Improved installation guide](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/basics/installation/) - more detailed information about the installation process, windows-specific instructions and more.
- [Improved web service section](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/webservice/) - improved documentation and more examples.
- [Cookie component documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/development/components/cookie/) - new documentation for the cookie component.

And last but not least, a brand new documentation for [PrestaShop on Docker](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/basics/installation/environments/docker/). There are also some other improvements, thanks to all contributors for their work!
