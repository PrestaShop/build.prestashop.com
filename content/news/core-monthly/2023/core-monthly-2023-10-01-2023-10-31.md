### PrestaShop Developer Conference

A few weeks ago we closed the call for papers for the conference, and it's time to share with you the agenda as well as speakers for the event. We received a lot of great submissions, and we're excited to share the agenda with you.

It is evident that many of you have been eagerly anticipating the first ever PrestaShop Developer Conference. We're happy to see that the community is so engaged and willing to share their knowledge with others. We're confident that the PrestaShop Developer Conference is a great opportunity for you to learn new things and meet other developers.

From many submissions we received, we selected 17 talks that will be presented during the conference. We will be sharing more details about the agenda this week in a blog post, stay tuned!

The conference will take place on November 30, 2023 in Paris. You can find the agenda and speakers on the [conference website](https://events.prestashop.com/prestashop-developer-conference/en).

### Changes on PrestaShop 8.1.x branch

We are slowly getting closer to the next patch version for PrestaShop 8.1. We've received some feedback from the community: on the new product page, the performance, with a lot of features, is not optimal. We're still working on improving the performance of the page, and we will be sharing more details about the changes soon.

Other than that, there are some minor bugfixes which you can find in the list of pull requests below.

### PrestaShop 9

With PrestaShop 9, there's certainly more going on. Work on Symfony Layout, API, cleaning: there is a lot of progress, but the team still needs some time to better present the results. Regarding the new API, which is being implemented into PrestaShop 9, [some interesting developments are happening](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34171), and we will be sharing more details about them soon!
A great time to learn more about the new API is the PrestaShop Developer Conference, where [@joelievre](https://github.com/jolelievre) will be [presenting the new API](https://events.prestashop.com/prestashop-developer-conference/en/sessions?searchtext=api&page=1) to the audience.


### Welcome to Dominik Shaim, new PrestaShop committer

In November we welcomed a new PrestaShop committer - [@ShaiMagal](Dominik Shaim), community member from Czech Republic and founder of [OpenServis](https://www.openservis.cz/), company specialized in the PrestaShop hosting and support. Dominik is experienced developer who work with PrestaShop since 2012, and he's been contributing to the project for a while now. We're happy to have him on board, and we're looking forward to working with him! You can see a list of all committers on [the PrestaShop project website](https://www.prestashop-project.org/project-organization/people-and-roles/#committers).

### Faceted search module

It is safe to say that for the last few months [@Hlavtox](https://github.com/Hlavtox) has taken over the development of the faceted search module. He's been working on improving the module and fixing bugs. In October, he released a new version of the module with yet another highly anticipated feature - the ability to filter by discounts, on sale and new products. You can get the new version of the module and see a full list of changes on [the module release page](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_facetedsearch/releases/tag/v3.14.0).

### PrestaShop Flashlight

The [PrestaShop Flashlight project](https://github.com/PrestaShop/prestashop-flashlight) that was presented during October's Live Update has been improved thanks to [@jokesterfr](https://github.com/jokesterfr). With new features, examples of use and more. Want to learn more about PrestaShop Flashlight? [Check the demo from the Live Update](https://youtu.be/tNAfcQhVmVM?t=817).

### Top Translators website

It's not that often when we can share news about the Top Translators website, but this month, we have some great news to share. The website has been updated thanks to incredible work from [@davidglezz](https://github.com/davidglezz). David migrated the website's code from React and jQuery to Vue.js, reduced the size of the page, and more. You can check the new version of the website on [the Top Translators website](https://translators.prestashop-project.org/). It looks the same, but it works better, is easier to maintain, and is more performant! Thank you [@davidglezz](https://github.com/davidglezz)!

### Developer documentation

Work on the developer documentation never stops! We have [some great projects in the pipeline](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/pulls), and we're excited to share them with you soon. In the meantime, you can check the improved "List of hooks" page, where we've implemented some visual changes to make it easier to navigate the page, and for documentation maintainers, to add new hooks to the list.

### VAT number module

The `vatnumber` module that was archived in October 2023, is now maintained by the [Friends of Presta association](https://friendsofpresta.org/). You'll now be able to download the new version of this module from [their `vatnumber` module repository](https://github.com/friends-of-presta/vatnumber).

### Live Update

Due to the PrestaShop Developer Conference, there will be no Live Update in November. We will be back in December with the next Live Update. We hope to see you there!
