The first Core Monthly of 2024 is here! üéâ  Let's dive into the progress we've made together in the first month of this promising year.

![Core Monthly banner](/assets/images/theme/banner-core-monthly-wide.jpg)

### Release of PrestaShop 8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11

In January we released security updates for PrestaShop 8.1 and 1.7.8. The updates fixed security vulnerabilities discovered by community researchers. We recommend that you update your store to the latest version of PrestaShop to ensure that your store is secure.

Want to know more about those releases? Head into the release notes for [PrestaShop 8.1.3]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-1-3-maintenance-release" >}}) and [PrestaShop 1.7.8.11]({{< relref "/news/releases/prestashop-1-7-8-11-maintenance-release" >}}).

It is important to note that the upgrade to PrestaShop 8.1.3 includes more than just security fixes. Therefore, it is recommended to use the [autoupgrade](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases) module for the upgrade process. For updating your PrestaShop 1.7.8 store, you can consider using the manual method. This involves replacing the files on your server with the new ones. You can find the list of changed files [here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/compare/1.7.8.10...1.7.8.11).

### Migration to Symfony 6

In January, we continued the migration to Symfony 6: as introduced last year, PrestaShop 9 will run on Symfony 6.4. We are making progress and we are getting closer to the finish line. The migration to Symfony 6 itself is, of course, a complicated process that will affect the community's solutions. We have this in mind and will present the first materials summarizing the impact of those changes on your work in March, during the Live Update. As with every major version of PrestaShop, and this time too, there will be a "Notable changes" page in the [developer documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/modules/core-updates/) that will summarize the essentials and present strategies for adaptation of your solutions.

### New API in PrestaShop 9

Another big project in PrestaShop 9 certainly is the new API. The new API will be based on [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/) and will be a significant improvement over the current one. In January, [@jolelievre](https://github.com/jolelievre) has been working on the new API and has made significant progress in this area, including the [handling of basic multi-shop and multi-lang endpoints](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34892). We will soon be preparing a series of content that will allow you to better understand the project's premise and, most importantly, how to take advantage of its capabilities in your solutions.

### PrestaShop 9

Work on version 9 of PrestaShop is underway. In the list of changes from branch `develop` you can again notice cleaning the codebase from old projects, unused functions or mechanisms. This is also a great opportunity to refactor some methods. One interesting change that was merged to the core in January is an improvement around the use of CLI in PrestaShop, making the life of developers working with PrestaShop a bit easier. You can learn more about these changes in the description of [this pull request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/35011). The coming months will undoubtedly allow us to present you with even more information about the upcoming version.

### PrestaShop 8.1.4

Version 8.1.3 was released in January: meanwhile, a number of [improvements and fixes are ready for version 8.1.4](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+milestone%3A8.1.4), which will make this version more stable. I won't discuss them in detail now I encourage you to click through and check the list. However, if you are using PrestaShop 8.1.3, you can pick up some of them today and implement them into your stores manually. I will be providing more information on 8.1.4 next month.

### Changes in the modules

PrestaShop is not only the Core, but also many native modules supported each month by project members. You may notice a lot of new versions that were released in January. A lot of these releases are small changes, to raise the minimum PHP version compatible with the module or to set a minimum compatible version of PrestaShop, that will work with it. This is to make it easier to maintain native modules. Of the work that went on in January, it is worth mentioning the great work done by [@Hlavtox](https://github.com/Hlavtox) on fixing potential problems with updating some modules. You can see one example [here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/gsitemap/pull/177). Another contribution worth mentioning is the work done by [@leemyongpakvn](https://github.com/leemyongpakvn) on the [productcomments](https://github.com/PrestaShop/productcomments) module. He has [made a lot of changes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/productcomments/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Aleemyongpakvn+milestone%3A6.0.3) to the module which will be part of the next release.

### Hummingbird

The Hummingbird is a new theme that will be available for PrestaShop 9. It is a modern and clean theme that will be a great starting point for developers to create their own themes. The work on the theme is still in progress, but you can already see the progress on the [Hummingbird repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/hummingbird/). Discussions between project members are currently underway to establish a plan to complete the theme so that version 1.0 will be released at the same time as PrestaShop 9.

### QA

We don't write about them often, but I think the beginning of the year is a great opportunity to remind people of how important a part of the project they are. Who am I writing about? About QA (Quality Assurance) team members. In every Core Monthly statement, you see a great deal of changes related to automated testing, and January was no different. The quality, quantity and accuracy of automated tests and tools used in the project continue to increase the stability of the software. If you want to know more about the work of the QA team, I encourage you to read the [PrestaShop Quality Council](https://www.prestashop-project.org/project-organization/quality-council/) page on the project's website and [UI Tests](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/testing/ui-tests/) section in the developer documentation.

The testing area of our project is also open. So, if you are interested in helping with it and getting involved, I invite you to visit our [Slack](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/) channel `#quality-assurance`.

### Live Update

In January we had the opportunity to meet again during the Live Update. The meeting was held on January 17th and was a great opportunity to learn about the progress of the project and to ask questions. If you missed the meeting, you can watch the recording on the [PrestaShop Project YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@prestashopproject).

In the first Live Update of the year [≈Åukasz Janik](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ljanik/), CEO of [Waynet E-commerce Agency](https://waynet.io/), presented his talk from the PrestaShop Developer Conference 2023 about the development optimization of PrestaShop stores and modules through the CI/CD process. The presentation was very interesting and I encourage you to watch it.

The next Live Update is scheduled for February 7th. This time, we will have yet another special guest: [Tomas Ilginis](https://github.com/tomas862), a developer from [Invertus](https://invertus.eu/en/), which is one of the leading agencies specializing in PrestaShop. Tomas will share insights on how himself and his colleagues at Invertus prefer to work with PrestaShop modules. This presentation was originally delivered during the [PrestaShop Developer Conference](https://events.prestashop.com/prestashop-developer-conference/en) in Paris.

Make sure to mark your calendar and join us on February 7th at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_7_Feb_2024_in_Paris) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HthBm3cbuno)!

### Summary

We started 2024 with a lot of work and a lot of plans. The project is moving forward and we are getting closer to the release of PrestaShop 9. The Live Update is a great opportunity to learn more about the project and to ask questions. I encourage you to join us in February and to watch the recording of the January meeting.
