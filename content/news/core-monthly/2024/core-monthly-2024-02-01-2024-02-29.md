With over 250 pull requests merged in the project repositories, February was a busy month for the PrestaShop open source project. We released the security patch, PrestaShop 8.1.4, and made significant progress on the new API. Let's take a look at the most important changes in the codebase.

### Release of PrestaShop 8.1.4

The 8.1.4 maintenance release of PrestaShop was a dedicated security release. This was the first instance where the decision was made to separate security fixes from other bug fixes and improvements, allowing for a quicker release of the security patch. The release went smoothly, leading to plans to continue this approach in future releases. It is recommended to upgrade to this version promptly to benefit from these security fixes. More details can be found in the [release notes]({{< ref "/news/releases/prestashop-8-1-4-maintenance-release.md" >}}).

### PrestaShop 8.1.5

The work on the next maintenance release, 8.1.5, has already started. The release is planned for March and will include a number of bug fixes and improvements. I'll share more on this in a dedicated blog post soon.

### PrestaShop 9.0

**PHP 8.3 compatibility**

PHP 8.3 [has been enabled](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/34485) for the `develop` branch on GitHub. [GitHub workflows in the project](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/actions/workflows/php.yml) now runs on PHP 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3, and all the tests are passing. This is a significant step towards ensuring that PrestaShop 9.0 will be compatible with the latest version of PHP.

**New API**

The progress of the new API for PrestaShop 9.0 is going well. This new API is being built using the API Platform framework, which gives a strong base for creating modern web APIs. It is a significant upgrade from the current one, providing developers with a more consistent and predictable experience.

One of the recent additions to the project is [introduction of `MutationTracker`](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/35292), which is responsible for tracking some of the changes made to the entities. Thanks to this, the API will be able to provide more information about the changes made to the resources. One example of this is the ability to track modifications to orders history via API calls. What is important to underline is that this is not a logging system, but a way to track changes made to the resources.

It's worth mentioning that the API Platform [has been updated to version 3.2](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/35266). We wanted to make sure that we are using the latest version of the API Platform framework, which will provide us with the latest features, improvements and fixes.

In the upcoming weeks, we will be releasing a series of blog posts to introduce the new API and its features. Stay tuned for more details.

**Symfony 6**

The work on upgrading the Symfony framework to version 6 is ongoing. The upgrade is a significant task, as it requires changes to many parts of the codebase. The upgrade will bring many improvements and new features, and it will also ensure that PrestaShop is using the LTS version of the the Symfony framework.

As part of the migration process to Symfony, we have a new version of two pages in back office:
- [Orders -> Shopping carts](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/35329)
- [Design -> Image settings](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/35192) (enabled with a feature flag)
- [Catalog -> Attributes & Features](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/32475) (enabled with a feature flag)

**Filter stock page by EAN13**

The stock management page in the back office [now includes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/35505) a new filter to search for products and combinations by their EAN13 code. This is a useful addition for merchants who need to quickly find products by their barcode.

### Modules

**Auto Upgrade**

The Auto Upgrade module has been updated to version 5.0.1. This release includes a number of improvements and bug fixes. The module now supports the upcoming version of PrestaShop, 8.1.5. More details can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v5.0.1).

**Google Analytics**

The Google Analytics module has been updated to version 5.0.0. This is a big update that includes a number of new features and improvements. The module now supports most of the events available in Google Analytics 4 and works with maximum amount of data available in the new version of the platform. More details can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_googleanalytics/releases/tag/v5.0.0). 

**Links list**

New version of the Links list module has been released. The module has been updated to version 6.0.7. Releases from 6.0.5 to 6.0.7, includes a number of improvements and bug fixes, some to critical issues reported by the community. More details can be found in the [release notes](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_linklist/releases).

**API Resources**

`ps_apiresources` includes the resources allowing using the API for the PrestaShop domain, all endpoints are based on CQRS commands/queries from the Core and we use API Platform framework as a base. It's a great example of how the new API endpoints implementation will look like. More details can be found in the [module repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_apiresources).

**Wishlist module**

There are no new features or improvemens in the module, but it's worth mentioning that this module is the first one where QA team introduced new automated tests. This is a great step towards improving the quality of the module and ensuring that it works as expected. More details can be found in the [module repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/blockwishlist/pull/236).

### Hummingbird theme

In February, we welcomed some new improvements to the Hummingbird theme, including a number of improvements regarding theme's accessibility. Thank you to everyone who contributed to these improvements. Make sure to check the [theme repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/hummingbird) for more details.

As we are getting closer to the release of PrestaShop 9.0, we are looking for more contributors to help us with the development and tests of Hummingbird.
You can visit Issues in the [Hummingbird repository](https://github.com/PrestaShop/hummingbird/issues) to find out how you can help.

### PrestaShop Project Live Update

In the February 2024 Live Update, Fabien Vallon introduced the upcoming Core Upgrade tool, and Tomas Ilginis from Invertus shared his experiences working with PrestaShop modules. More details can be found in the [Live Update summary]({{< relref "/news/public-oss-demo/2024/live-update-february-2024" >}}). The next Live Update will be on March 13th, 2024 at [4 pm (Paris time)](https://time.is/1600_13_Mar_2024_in_Paris). We will be sharing more details soon. We look forward to your participation!
