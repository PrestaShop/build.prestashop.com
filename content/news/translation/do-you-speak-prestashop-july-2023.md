Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in July.

## Project news

## 🇯🇵/ 🇧🇦Looking for Japanese & Bosnian translators and proofeaders

🇯🇵The Japanese translation project is looking for translators and proofreaders! If you wish to join efforts and help contributor [momo-i](https://crowdin.com/profile/momo-i) translate PrestaShop into Japanese — or if you simply want to ask a question, [send me a message on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/lea.delin) or on Slack! 📨

🇧🇦The Bosnian translation project is also looking for proofreaders: the project is almost fully translated. There is only 7% of strings left to proofread and validate! With your help, the Bosnian project could reach 100% availability next month! 💪

## 📖 New Basque proofreader

This month, Basque and Spanish translator [Aitor Salaberria](https://crowdin.com/profile/a_mento) joined the Basque proofreading team. Congrats and thank you for your help! Keep up the great work 👏

## A few stats

* **5 members** joined the project this month.
* **18 members** were active on the project.
* A total of **73,679 words have been translated** and **15,128 validated**.
(For reference, there are roughly 73,000 words in J.D. Salinger’s *The Catcher in the Rye*!)

Thank you all very much for your involvement!

There is only **1%** of strings to translate and proofread! 💪

Congratulations and a huge thank you to all of you, contributors! 🎉
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active.
Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!
