Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about coding, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in November 2023.

## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of November, PrestaShop 8 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **14 languages**. Thatâ€™s great! Thank you for your contribution.

| Catalan | Chinese Traditional | Czech | Dutch | 
| English | French | Hungarian | Italian | 
| Persian | **Romanian** | **Serbian** | Slovak | 
| Spanish | Ukrainian | 
 
#### Almost there!

**5** languages are almost fully available: 

| Greek | Korean | Polish | Lithuanian | Portuguese |

There are less than 2% of strings to translate and proofread! You can do it! :muscle: 

Congratulations and a huge thank you to all of you, contributors! :party-popper: 
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active.
Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the translation percentage would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!
