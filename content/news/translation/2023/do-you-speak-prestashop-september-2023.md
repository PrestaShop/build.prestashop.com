Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in September 2023.

## Project news

## New strings are ready for translation

As you may have noticed, new strings were added to Crowdin on September 28. It's usually not possible to add new strings outside the release of a minor or major version of PrestaShop but we had to do it to fix a [bug](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/32212).
To go back to a 100% completion rate, those strings will need to be translated and validated. You can find the untranslated strings in the 8 file. Your project needs you! :muscle: 

## A few stats

* **6 members** joined the project this month.
* **31 members** were active on the project.
* A total of **22,888 words have been translated** and **17,000 validated**.
* All this in **22 different languages**.
 
Thank you all very much for your involvement!

## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of September, PrestaShop 8 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **11 languages**. That‚Äôs great! Thank you for your contribution.

| **Catalan** | **Chinese Traditional** | **Czech** | **Dutch** | 
| **English** | French | **Hungarian**| Italian | 
| **Persian** | **Spanish** | **Ukrainian** | 
 
#### Almost there!

**18** languages are almost fully available: 

| Greek | Korean | Portuguese | Slovak |

There are less than 2% of strings to translate and proofread! You can do it! :muscle: 


Congratulations and a huge thank you to all of you, contributors! :party-popper: 
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active.
Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!
