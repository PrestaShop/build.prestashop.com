It's been decided to release a security patch for version 8.1 of PrestaShop.

![8.1.4 is available!](/assets/images/2024/02/banner_8.1.4_1534x424.png)

The security patch for version 8.1 of PrestaShop is now available. This is the first release where it's been decided to separate the security fixes from the other bug fixes and improvements, allowing the release of the security patch as soon as possible.

It is recommended that you upgrade your shop quickly in order to benefit from these fixes. Of course, donâ€™t forget to create a backup before. You can upgrade to the latest version using the [1-Click Upgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/).

You can see a full changelog on the [release page](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases/tag/8.1.4).

Since version 8.1.4 is a "patch" update, upgrading from previous 8.1.x versions should happen without any issues. As for every upgrade, it's highly recommended to do a full manual backup beforehand.

If you encounter any problems during the upgrade that, in your opinion, are not caused by third-party modules or modifications used in your shop, [submit a bug report](https://www.prestashop-project.org/get-involved/report-issues/).
