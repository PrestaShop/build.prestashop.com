## What is PrestaShop Build Blog?

This blog is where project members communicate directly with the community. It's especially targeted at those who contribute (to core, translations, documentation, modules/themes, etc.)

This blog is about everything that has to do with PrestaShop project. The whole PrestaShop project team contributes: developers, product managers, designers, tech writers, etc. [We welcome your contributions](#contribute)!

We write about everything that happens to the PrestaShop software:

* New releases,
* Activity in the project in the past month,
* The upcoming improvements in the codebase, 
* Current and future architecture changes, 

...and all behavior changes that might affect you as a developer, a module/theme author, or simply as a Open Source fan :)

This blog also hosts How-Tos on certain features, we share best practices and tips on how to work with PrestaShop.
