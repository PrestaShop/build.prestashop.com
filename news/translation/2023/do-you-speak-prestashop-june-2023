Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it's also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the software translations evolved in June.

## Project news

## üåç Translating the PrestaShop documentation

If you didn‚Äôt know, you can help translate the [PrestaShop 8 documentation](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/welcome/) into your own language! 
For now, the PrestaShop 8 docs are only available in English and French, but if you wish to help translate it, let me know. Your help is always welcome! üôå

If you wish to learn more about how to contribute to doc translations, check out the [Translator‚Äôs documentation](https://docs.prestashop-project.org/translating-prestashop/translating-prestashop-software-basics/translating-documentation)!

## ü´µ Proofreaders, your project needs you!

The PrestaShop project is still actively looking for proofreaders! If you feel that your translations aren't validated fast enough and want to speed up the process (or if you simply wish to help other translators in your language) then consider becoming a proofreader ‚Äî your help is always needed! 

If you're interested in becoming a proofreader, [send me a message on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/profile/lea.delin) or on Slack! üì®

### üíï Many thanks to June newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. This month, 5 people joined the project and started translating right away!

That's why I'd like to thank [domagtom](https://crowdin.com/profile/domagtom/), [Roman Sekeres](https://crowdin.com/profile/roman.seko/), [Wongcie Cahyono](https://crowdin.com/profile/wongciecahyono) and [Dmytro Zvieriev](https://crowdin.com/profile/biogent), as well as [KateNong](https://crowdin.com/profile/katenong/activity) who rushed into the efforts immediately!

Thank you all! 

## A few stats

* **12 members** joined the project this month.
* **25 members** were active on the project.
* A total of **74,583 words have been translated** and **75,228 validated**. 
(That's about as many words as Phillip K. Dick's *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*, congrats!) üéâ
* All this in **23 different languages**.
 
Thank you all very much for your involvement!

|-----------|--------------|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Chinese (simplified) | Chinese (traditional) | Greek | Hungarian | Korean |
| Lithuanian | Persian | Portuguese (Brazil) | Romanian | Ukrainian |

There is only **1%** of strings to translate and proofread! üí™

Congratulations and a huge thank you to all of you, contributors! üéâ
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active.
Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

## Let‚Äôs keep in touch!
