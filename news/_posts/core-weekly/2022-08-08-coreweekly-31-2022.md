## General messages

Dear developers,

The ongoing work with PrestaShop 8 Beta is still the team's number one priority. Last week a new Distribution API Client and Contextual Help API were released, two modules that are an integral part of the upcoming version, replacing the old Module Manager and back office help sidebar.

A few months ago, the `Classic` theme stopped being used in PrestaShop 8 core's repository. It is now included as a project's dependency using Composer. This is why the team [created a new tag](https://github.com/PrestaShop/classic-theme/releases/tag/2.0.0-beta) on its repository to ensure that PrestaShop 8 will use a theme version dedicated to this particular release.

Expect more news about PrestaShop 8 Beta in the upcoming days.
