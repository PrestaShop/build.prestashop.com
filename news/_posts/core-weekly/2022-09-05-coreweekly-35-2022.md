## General messages

Dear developers,

PrestaShop 8 beta phase has ended. Quality Assurance team will post all the regressions discovered after exploratory tests in the [release progress page on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/26427). QA and Maintainers' team will now focus on fixing and testing issues considered as blocking for the release, as well as on the work on the [autoupgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) to ensure that the upgrade path from 1.7 to 8.0 is stable.

In other news, Maintainers' team released a security patch for the [Product Comments](https://github.com/PrestaShop/productcomments) module. We highly recommend upgrading it.

Last but not least, a reminder about this week's Public Demo that will [take place on Wednesday](https://build.prestashop.com/news/upcoming-demo-6-2022/).
