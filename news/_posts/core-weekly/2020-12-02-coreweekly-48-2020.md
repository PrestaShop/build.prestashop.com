## General messages

Dear developers,

The past week has seen many major releases for the PHP ecosystem: [php 8.0](https://www.php.net/releases/8.0/), [xdebug 3](https://xdebug.org/announcements/2020-11-25), [Flysystem 2](https://flysystem.thephpleague.com/v2/docs/what-is-new/) and multiple versions of [Symfony](https://symfony.com/blog/a-week-of-symfony-726-23-29-november-2020) including the latest Symfony3 release: v3.4.47.

We had high hopes to be able to add to this list PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 but unfortunately this did not happen.

Thanks to the huge work of QA Team, multiples issues have been identified in the upgrade process from previous 1.7 versions to 1.7.7.0. As the ability to upgrade is a major keystone for security and stability, we could not release PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 with such issues.

**QA Team has validated the 1.7.7.0 release**. The only missing piece to release it is to validate the stability of the upgrade process, and that is a tough task as there are a great number of paths to be explored.

Informations about the release status continue to be provided on [the release tracking issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/18647) for 1.7.7.0.
