## General messages

1.7.3.0 is coming soon, folks! We know we've been talking about it a lot lately but the code should be frozen in the next few days, meaning a release planned for December. We're still working on it but you can already [have a look at its code](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/tree/develop) to try it out!

Also, end of last week was full of weird blue elephpants soft toys for us, maybe you know what we mean... Indeed, it was the AFUP's annual conference in Paris, and it was covered by our dream team of developers, @eternoendless, @Quetzacoalt91 and @tomlev! And we can tell they came back from the PHP Forum with a lot of tips and ideas regarding all of the PHP and open-source communities. So keep in touch, no doubt they will share some parts in here.
