## General messages

Dear developers,

The Quality Assurance team completed tests of PrestaShop release candidate 1, finding some bugs blocking the final release. You can read the [full report here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/26427#issuecomment-1273452133).

We managed to [fix issues with the search](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/issues/1052#issuecomment-1271405492) in the developer documentation. There are still improvements to be made, which we plan to address.

Last week was held the seventh Public Demo of the year. You can read more about it in [this summary](/news/public-demo-7-2022/). You are encouraged to watch its video replay with one live demonstration and the projectâ€™s news presented in that session.
