## General messages

Dear developers,

With the help of the community, the maintainers team focused on the PrestaShop 8.0.0 Beta release. You can follow the release process [here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/26427). The work continues, but we expect a Beta version very soon. Stay tuned!

A few weeks ago, we started organizing cyclic meetings of maintainers and committers, where we discuss various topics to help the project move forward and address some issues. One we discussed was the process of releasing a new version of modules.
The effects of the discussion are already visible! @matks [created an application](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps-monitor-module-releases) that generates [a page](https://build.prestashop.com/ps-monitor-module-releases/) available for everyone where we can monitor which modules should be released. This will help us better monitor this process.

In other news, the ADR explaining the project's [backward compatibility promise](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ADR/pull/25) has been merged, and from now on, the project will follow its rules. We encourage you to look, as it should help you better understand what to expect from future releases.

Last but not least: in August, a lot of people enjoy their well-deserved vacation. We decided to skip this month's Public Demo: the next one will be in September, where you should expect a few fantastic demos.
