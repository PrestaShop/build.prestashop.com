## General messages

Dear developers,

Multiple new applications have been submitted to join the team: [marsaldev](https://github.com/PrestaShop/open-source/issues/105) for committer position and [PrestaEdit](https://github.com/PrestaShop/open-source/issues/106) for maintainer position. This is great news!

In the meantime, the QA team is still going through the 8.0.0 alpha functional campaign which aims to evaluate how much work would be needed before being able to deliver an 8.0.0 alpha build.

Also the next session of the public PrestaShop demo from the maintainers team will happen [this week, on Wednesday, July 6, 2022 at 4pm CEST](https://build.prestashop.com/news/upcoming-demo-5-2022/)!
