## General messages

Dear developers,

The maintainers team was very busy these last few days because of the [major security vulnerability](/news/major-security-vulnerability-on-prestashop-websites/) discovered last week. If you haven't read this article yet, please do it now.

Following the discovery of the vulnerability, [PrestaShop version 1.7.8.7 was delivered](/news/prestashop-1-7-8-7-maintenance-release/). It contains a fix that strengthens MySQL Smarty cache storage against code injection attacks.

While the security work on 1.7.8.7 happened, the 8.0.0 Beta release got much closer to delivery, thanks to everyone from the PrestaShop community! Only a few remaining items are left before we can publish and host a [Beta testing period](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/project/release/minor-release-lifecycle/#public-beta-period).
