## General messages

Dear developers,

This is the month of July and many people are enjoying some deserved time off, so in the following weeks, PrestaShop's project development will probably slow down.

This did not prevent some wonderful people from joining the [committers](https://www.prestashop-project.org/maintainers-guide/how-to-become-a-committer/) team! As announced during the [July Project Public Demo Session](https://build.prestashop.com/news/public-demo-5-2022/), the maintainer team is very happy to welcome long-time contributors Julius Žukauskas ([@zuk3975](https://github.com/zuk3975)), Mahmoud Parvazi ([@mparvazi](https://github.com/mparvazi)), Marco Salvatore ([@marsaldev](https://github.com/marsaldev)) and Tomasz Zając ([@SharakPL](https://github.com/SharakPL))!
