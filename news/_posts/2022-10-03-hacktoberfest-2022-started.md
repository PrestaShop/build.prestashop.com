October is now here and Hacktoberfest, a month-long celebration of open source software, has started. We have recently written an article about the event, how you can get involved and all the different rules. You can know more [in our Hacktoberfest 2022 article](/news/hacktoberfest-2022/).

In a few words, participation is very simple: people are encouraged to create at least 4 pull requests for open source projects on GitHub.

## Contribute to the PrestaShop project

The maintainer team hopes you will help with your contributions during Hacktoberfest. In the documentation, you will find a [dedicated page to help you start](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/contribute/).

As this event also includes lower code contributions, you can contribute to the [developer documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/), [translations](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official) or you can write a [guest post for the blog](https://build.prestashop-project.org/howtos/misc/how-to-write-on-this-blog/) that you’re reading right now.

This year’s edition of the event is significantly emphasizing all contributions, whether these are code, low code or even non-code contributions. This being a celebration of open source software, PrestaShop is very proud to participate and to involve the community. Many thanks go to [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com) for sponsoring this year’s event.

Happy contributing everyone!
