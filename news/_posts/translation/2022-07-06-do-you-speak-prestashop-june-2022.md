Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in June!

## Project news

### ðŸ’• Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [MichaÅ‚ Boruta](https://crowdin.com/profile/eveneme) and [joeurassa
](https://crowdin.com/profile/joeurassa), who rushed into the efforts immediately!

## A few stats
 
* **12 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **6,397 words have been translated** and **4,256 validated**.
* All this in **11 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

Congratulations, and welcome to our new top contributors! :clap:
 
Remember, you can see who has been contributing to our translation project thanks to the [Translators page](https://translators.prestashop.com/).
 
## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of June, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **14 languages**. Thatâ€™s great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| Bosnian | Catalan | Chinese Traditional | **Chinese Simplified ** |
| Danish | English | Estonian | French | 
| Hungarian | **Italian** | Lithuanian | Portuguese, BR | 
| Swedish | Ukrainian |

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, 42 strings were added on May 6 to Crowdin to fix [a bug](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_emailalerts/pull/57). To go back to a 100% completion rate, those strings will need to be translated and validated. Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Spanish, Mexico, Finnish, and Korean are almost fully available. There is only 1% of strings to proofread. 
There isnâ€™t much work left, so if you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please send an email to translation@prestashop.com or write me (Julie Varisellaz) on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-1aknrecdu-2jS1sCOKDhOVk2UOhpzmfg). Your help is needed!

## Languages with the best evolution

The following languages had the best progress in April thanks to the translation community:
 
* **Albanian** (+4% to reach 39% validated) 
* **Polish** (+4% to reach 100% translated)
* **Chinese Simplified** (+1% to reach 100% translated and validated)


Congratulations!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!
