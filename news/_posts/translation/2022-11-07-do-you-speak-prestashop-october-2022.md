Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in October!

## Project news

### ‚ûï PrestaShop 8 is now available to the world üéâ

PrestaShop 8 is here! While it‚Äôs been translated in multiple languages already (thank you all for your contributions!), new translation strings are added regularly, so keep an eye out. 
Of course, other languages are still available for translation, and you are more than welcome to help contribute to the different language projects!

### Proofreaders needed

We are looking for proofreaders for the Spanish (Argentina), Galician and Flemish project! So if you want to help us, reach me on either Crowdin or Slack, I‚Äôd be more than happy to guide you üôå

If you wish to become a proofreader for any other language, let me know! We are always actively looking for proofreaders üëè

### A little teaser 

We are working on a Translation Guide for the Crowdin translation project members, aka you, contributors!  This should make translation easier for everyone, and includes useful ressources and tips.
If there is any topic you‚Äôd like to be explained in this guide, let us know on the Slack channel. ‚úçÔ∏è


### üíï Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [thb5309](https://crowdin.com/profile/thb5309) who rushed into the efforts immediately!

## A few stats

* **21 members joined the project this month.**
* **35 members** were active on the project.
* A total of **17,855 words have been translated** and **16,067 validated**.
* All this in **28 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!

## Let‚Äôs keep in touch!
