Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in May!

### üíï Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [teratux](https://crowdin.com/profile/teratux), who rushed into the efforts immediately!

## A few stats
 
* **15 members** were active on the project this month.
* A total of **10,793 words have been translated** and **8,705 validated**.
* All this in **26 different languages**.
 
Thank you very much for your involvement!

Congratulations, and welcome to our new top contributors! :clap:
 
Remember, you can see who has been contributing to our translation project thanks to the [Translators page](https://translators.prestashop.com/).
 
## Complete translations
 
#### Fully available languages
 
At the end of May, PrestaShop 1.7.8 was fully available (= 100% translated and validated) in **12 languages**. That‚Äôs great! Thank you for your involvement. :tada:
 
| Bosnian | Catalan | Chinese Traditional | Danish | 
| English | Estonian | French | Hungarian | 
| Lithuanian | **Portuguese, BR** | Swedish | Ukrainian |

Thank you all for your contribution! And remember, 42 strings were added on May 6 to Crowdin to fix [a bug](https://github.com/PrestaShop/ps_emailalerts/pull/57). To go back to a 100% completion rate, those strings will need to be translated and validated. Your project needs you! :muscle: 

#### Almost there!

Korean and Finnish are almost fully available. There is only 1% of strings to proofread. 
There isn‚Äôt much work left, so if you wish to help to proofread what has been translated, please send an email to translation@prestashop.com or write me (Julie Varisellaz) on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/prestashop/shared_invite/zt-dkmbz5qf-I~FlEWwmRUOXunc5ui0Ucg). Your help is needed!
