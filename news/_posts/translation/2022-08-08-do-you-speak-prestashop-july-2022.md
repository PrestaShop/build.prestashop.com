Contributing to PrestaShop is not only about the code, it is also about taking part in the [PrestaShop translation project](https://crowdin.com/project/prestashop-official)! This report will tell you how the translations of the software evolved in July!

## Project news

### üíï Many thanks to newcomers

Many people subscribe to the project(s) of their choice each month, but not so many start translating straight away. For that reason, we would like to thank [Francisco GP](https://crowdin.com/profile/iguannaweb) who rushed into the efforts immediately! 

### ‚ûï PrestaShop 8 is ready for translation

As you probably noticed with the announcement of the beta release a few days ago, PrestaShop 8 is on its way! While it brings new features, this new version also means new strings. A file containing all 1.7.8 strings has been pushed to Crowdin, and is ready for translation!

Even though the wording is always reviewed when a pull request is submitted, some mistakes could have been missed. So, don‚Äôt hesitate to let us know if you notice something wrong so that we can correct it. Note that, despite the string freeze, we will wait a few weeks before adding the corrections to Crowdin. After that, we won‚Äôt be able to add any new wordings. 
And as version 8 has not been released yet, some strings may appear a bit unclear because of the lack of context. In this case, please don‚Äôt hesitate to ask for help! You can open an issue in the ‚ÄúComments‚Äù section of a string and I will do my best to answer your questions. In any case, don‚Äôt forget that you will still be able to modify the translations when the new version is released.

* **Albanian** (+5% to reach 44% translated and validated) 
* **Czech** (+1% to reach 100% translated and validated)
* **Slovak** (+1% to reach 100% translated)

A huge thank you to all the contributors!
 
Of course, this is highlighting the languages that made some progress with new translations; but it does not mean that the languages that are not mentioned here are not active. Indeed, some editing and rewriting may be going on, but the percentage of translation would not be modified (since the work happens on strings that are already translated). So let's not forget about the work of other contributors! Thanks to you too!
