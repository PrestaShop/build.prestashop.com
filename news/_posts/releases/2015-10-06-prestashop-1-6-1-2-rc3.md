We received quite a few feedback reports and pull-requests since we released v1.6.1.2 RC1 two weeks ago, so here's the RC3, which fixes some more issues, and polishes a few more lines of code.

<b>NOTE</b>: The RC2 was first uploaded yesterday (Monday 5th) with a [slight parenthesis issue](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/4172/files) which broke many pages. It was fixed by our Core team and repackaged at around 3 PM (Paris time), and [two more](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/cf2901d3a3c2e7ff3ffe23092ea99cb5fa753192) [small corrections](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/commit/6b2d200ea0148f12932b9796986e3ec155397b72) since then have proven essential, hence the RC3. If you downloaded the RC2, please download the RC3 now!

Remember! This is the third release candidate for 1.6.1.2, NOT the final, production-ready code! <b>This is a test version</b>, and is therefore not yet deemed suitable for production use. Hence, do not upgrade your store just yet! Install the RC3 on your server (on as many server configurations as possible, please!), or upgrade from a clone of your real store.
