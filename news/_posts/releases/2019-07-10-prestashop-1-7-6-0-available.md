We are happy to announce PrestaShop 1.7.6.0 is officially available!

It has been quite a journey to deliver this huge release, our biggest yet since 1.7.1.0. Six months of development, a six week-long Beta, two Release Candidates... Was it worth it? We absolutely think so, and hope that you will enjoy using it.

In this version we focused on improving and bringing back important 1.6 features to merchants, and kept working on code quality and performance improvements. We have made important progress on the Symfony migration as well.

**Back office**
- Manage and preview your transactional emails directly from a new back-office page: Email Theme.
- In order to gather all prices in the same place, a “Price (tax incl.)” column has been added to the product listing. In one glance, it is now possible to get both tax included and excluded prices for each product.
- New helper cards have been added on important pages to improve the software onboarding: Categories, Customers, Pages, Employees.
- Dynamic preview of search engine results have been added to more pages: Product page, Categories, CMS.

- Improved translation system for multilingual modules.
- The Design section of the back office has been reworked. Now you are able to have an overview of all design features (RTL, logos, favicon and theme) and manage them the way you want.

## Major Bug Fixes

**Front Office**
- Checkout used to proceed automatically from carrier selection to payment selection, it was an issue for some carrier modules requiring extra configuration steps in the carrier selection.
- Enhanced security checks for virtual goods. Previously anyone with the correct link (correct &key=... URL parameter) could download a virtual good.
- We fixed a longtime bug that was creating an error in discount calculation when adding a cart rule in a cart containing only virtual product.
- In the meantime, we also fixed a bug on carrier price calculation. Price is now calculated on the real order price and not the one including after a discount is applied
- DNI fields is now forced only for countries which require it
- Fixed the minimum order in the second currency bug - fixed by the [community](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/9665)

**Core**
- Themes are not reset anymore when already active (also prevent hooks to be reset) - fixed in the Autoupgrade module
