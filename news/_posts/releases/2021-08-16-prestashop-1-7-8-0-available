* It is now possible to export back-office, front-office, email, themes, and module translations.
* Modules using the  [new translation system](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/creation/module-translation/new-system/)  introduced in 1.7.6 can now distribute their own translation files in the XLF format. Users can use the export tool to migrate from legacy PHP catalogue to XLF catalogue
Developers have better translation system to manage the translations of their modules or themes.

##  New multistore header

You can search search shop and personalized on the multistore header. The new header offers a brand new multistore experience for the merchants.
[Here to see the detail of the feature](https://build.prestashop.com/news/multistore-news-in-1.7.8/) 

## The implementation of Native Lazy Loading on theme Classic
[illustration lazy loading](/assets/images/2021/10/illustration_lazy_loading.png)
Lazy loading is a technique that defers the loading of non-critical resources to the page load. We recommend all theme developers to this technology to enhance their themes to improve the merchant’s store performances.

## Improvement of the UI
[illustration ui kit](/assets/images/2021/10/illustration_ui_kit.png)
PrestaShop back-office UI Kit has been improved to have a solid Design System with adjustment of alert colors, font size, buttons contrasts, and an enhancement of the responsiveness.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** if you plan on upgrading your shop to 1.7.8 and your current version is **below 1.7.6** you need to use the latest version (4.11.0) of our [1-Click Upgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade). Of course, it’s always recommended using the latest version when upgrading, but even more so in this case since a bug related to upgrading from these older versions has been fixed in the module.

## And many more features and improvements
If you are looking for more details about all changes and new features expected in 1.7.8, the [1.7.8 beta version release note](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-0-beta-release/) is the perfect article for you to read!

## Notable fixes since RC1
The RC allowed a member of the community to detect a bug on the CLI. 
This major bug [#25982](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/25959) blocked the installation of a PrestaShop from the CLI. 

## Changelog

1 492 pull requests have been merged since the beginning of the version development. Read the [Changelog](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases/tag/1.7.8.0) for details.
