## The implementation of Native Lazy Loading on theme Classic

Lazy loading is a technique that defers the loading of non-critical resources to the page load. We recommend all theme developers to this technology to enhance their themes to improve the merchant’s store performances.

## Improvement of the UI

PrestaShop back-office UI Kit has been improved to have a solid Design System with adjustment of alert colors, font size, buttons contrasts, and an enhancement of the responsiveness.

**IMPORTANT NOTE** if you plan on upgrading your shop to 1.7.8 and your current version is **below 1.7.6** you need to use the latest version (4.11.0) of our [1-Click Upgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade). Of course, it’s always recommended using the latest version when upgrading, but even more so in this case since a bug related to upgrading from these older versions has been fixed in the module.

## And many more features and improvements
If you are looking for more details about all changes and new features expected in 1.7.8, the [1.7.8 beta version release note](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-7-0-beta-release/) is the perfect article for you to read!

## Notable fixes since RC1
The RC allowed a member of the community to detect a bug on the CLI. This major bug [#25982](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/25959) blocked the installation of a PrestaShop from the CLI. 

## Changelog

1 492 pull requests have been merged since the beginning of the version development. Read the [Changelog](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases/tag/1.7.8.0) for details.
