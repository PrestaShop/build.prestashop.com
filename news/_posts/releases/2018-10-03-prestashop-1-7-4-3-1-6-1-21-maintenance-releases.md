A very special thank to Panatan from the forum and to Robin Peraglie for the security reports!

Since version 1.7.4.3 is a "patch" update to version 1.7.4.2, upgrading from any 1.7.4 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.4.x will work just as well with 1.7.4.3.<br/>
Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.

This the same for 1.6.1.21 regarding 1.6.1.x versions.
