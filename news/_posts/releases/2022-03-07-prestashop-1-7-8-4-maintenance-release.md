Reminder: the latest version of the 1-Click Upgrade module is v4.14.0, don't forget to upgrade it.

Since version 1.7.8.4 is a “patch” update to version 1.7.8.3, upgrading from any 1.7.8 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.8.x will work just as well with 1.7.8.3. Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.
