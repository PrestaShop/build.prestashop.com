As the version number indicates (as per [our SemVer-like versioning](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/)), this is the 17th patch release for PrestaShop 1.6.1.0.

As usual, if you are currently running promotions leading to high traffic on your website, we recommend that you wait for the promotion to end before attempting any upgrade and technical change to your store.

We hope you enjoy this new release!


### The changes

For a full list of changes, [see the list of pull requests merged into the 1.6.1.x branch in this milestone](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Amerged%20milestone%3A1.6.1.17)

Here are some of the most notable changes that this version brings:

* Much speedier search queries!
* Fixed the currency display in supply order
* Fixed the coverage calculations in Stock Cover Report
* Fixed price display based on the Customer_Groups feature
* Fixed error when deleting a cart (thank you @cdoublev!)
* Fixed id_shop routing (thank you @cdoublev!)
* Fixed gift display in My Voucher page in My Account (thank you @matt75!)
* Fixed duplicate URL for supplier list (thank you @matt75!)
* ...and more!


The [PrestaShop 1.6.1.17 changelog](https://www.prestashop.com/en/system/files/ps_releases/changelog_1.6.1.17.txt) is available.

Because version 1.6.1.17 is a "patch" update to the 1.6.1.x branch, upgrading from that branch will be as smooth as silk for everyone: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.6.1.0 will work just as well with 1.6.1.17.

This release had 5 contributors, both from PrestaShop and from the Community at large.

A huge "thank you!" to each of the 3 outside contributors, who gave their time and knowledge for the benefit of the whole PrestaShop community! [You too can contribute to the next version](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Contributing+code+to+PrestaShop)!

Let's go, [upgrade your store(s)](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Updating+PrestaShop)! Upgrading from 1.6.1.x is completely safe; upgrading from a standard 1.6.0.x version should work just as well. Those upgrading from version 1.5, 1.4 or even 1.3 should take their time and pay attention to their modules, their theme and their custom modifications!
