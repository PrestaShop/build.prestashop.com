Since version 1.7.3.3 is a "patch" update to version 1.7.3.2, upgrading from any 1.7.3 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.3.x will work just as well with 1.7.3.3.<br/>
Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.

This the same for 1.6.1.19 regarding 1.6.1 version.
