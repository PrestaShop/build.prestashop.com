We are happy to announce that [PrestaShop 1.7.0.0](https://www.prestashop.com/en/1.7) is now available for testing in its 2nd Beta version. More than ever, we need YOUR feedback as a merchant, a service provider, a module developer or a theme designer.

The release of this second Beta version is another important milestone in the current period of intensive testing and debugging by the PrestaShop developers.

<br/>

**PrestaShop 1.7.0.0 is still in development**, which means that this new Beta release is a great opportunity for you to discover it before we release a stable version!<br/>
Go download and install the Beta 2 version as a test store, either on your machine or your web hosting, then play with it – and [give us your feedback](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1)!

While all hands are on deck, we couldn't do it without the help of the whole community: we need YOU to test this new version of PrestaShop.<br/>
Change the settings, browse the default theme, check if the modules that you created still work as-is (or with tiny design adaptations), etc. And most importantly, let us know about your findings!<br/>
[Update your module's code if needs be](http://build.prestashop.com/news/module-development-changes-in-17/), and check out the [current theme documentation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/blob/master/TABLE%20OF%20CONTENT.md) (still in Beta too - [let us know if something is amiss](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs/issues)!)


## How to give feedback about Beta 2

Have you found a bug? A curious behavior? An unexpected reaction? Let us know! [Create a ticket on the 1.7 Forge project](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1), and give us as much details as possible!

Please note that we are not looking for feedback on the overall technical or design choices: Symfony2, the new theming system, the back office design and other global aspects of 1.7 are pretty much set in stone. However, do let us know about bugs or possible improvements!
