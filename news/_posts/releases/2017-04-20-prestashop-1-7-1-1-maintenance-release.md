PrestaShop 1.7.1.1 is now available. This maintenance release closes more than 20 of the most pressing issues reported since v1.7.1.0.

Version 1.7.1.0, [released two weeks ago](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-1-0-available/), was a step forward for PrestaShop 1.7, bringing more performance and stability to the whole codebase, as well as some new features and several native modules, among which the long-awaited PayPal module.

We received a lot of feedback from the community as soon as PrestaShop 1.7.1.0 was released. The team has been working hard at fixing the most critical issues, and today we are happy to deliver the first "patch" release of PrestaShop 1.7.1.0 (as per [our SemVer-like versioning](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/)).

Want to upgrade using the 1-Click Upgrade module? Make sure to upgrade the module first! This way you will have access to a new, 1.7-specific channel, which makes upgrading safer for merchants. Upgrading from 1.7.1.0 to 1.7.1.1 should be smooth as silk -- but do a safety backup anyway :)

The [PrestaShop 1.7.1.1 changelog](https://www.prestashop.com/en/developers-versions/changelog/1.7.1.1-stable) is available.

Since version 1.7.1.1 is a "patch" update to version 1.7.1.0, upgrading from that version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.1.0 will work just as well with 1.7.1.1.<br/>
Upgrades from a standard 1.7.0.x version should work just as well, and those upgrading from older versions (1.6, 1.5, 1.4 or even older) should take their time and pay attention to their modules, their theme and their custom modifications!
