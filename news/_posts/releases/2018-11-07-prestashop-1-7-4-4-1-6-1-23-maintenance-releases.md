PrestaShop 1.7.4.4 and 1.6.1.23 are now available. These versions fix a security issue for both 1.7.4.x and 1.6.1.x. For the details, please read below:

These two security updates fix issues on the file manager integrated in the text editor component in the Back Office. By exploiting a combination of security vunerabilities, an authenticated user in the Back Office could upload a malicious file that would then allow him or her to execute arbitrary code on the server.

Since these versions fix security problems, we **strongly** encourage you to upgrade your shop as soon as possible.

Changes for 1.7.4.4:

- Back Office:
  - Bug fix:
    - #11228: Avoid warning in WebServiceRequest
    - #11285: Fix filemanager security breaches

    - #11286: Fix filemanager security breaches

Contributors to this patch versions, from both the Core team and the community at large: 
Thank you! Three of you contributed for the very first time, warm welcome :-)

A very special thank to Fariskhi Vidyan (@farisv) for the security reports, and his help during our correction of these issues!

Since version 1.7.4.4 is a "patch" update to version 1.7.4.3, upgrading from any 1.7.4 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.4.x will work just as well with 1.7.4.4.<br/>
Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.

This the same for 1.6.1.23 regarding 1.6.1.x versions.
