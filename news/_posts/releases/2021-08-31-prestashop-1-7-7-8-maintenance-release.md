We suggest upgrading your shop quickly in order to benefit from these fixes. Of course, don’t forget to backup before.

## Major issues on the product page

- The issue [#25718](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/25718) and [#25753](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/25753) appeared due to the implementation of the numeric data format for number fields on the 1.7.7.6 patch version. This regression prevents users to edit the impact of a combination and causes rounding problems on the impact calculation. 

- An exception is displayed when combination feature is disabled on the performance page [#25782](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/25782)

Since version 1.7.7.8 is a “patch” update to version 1.7.7, upgrading from any 1.7.7 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.7.x will work just as well with 1.7.7.8. Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.
