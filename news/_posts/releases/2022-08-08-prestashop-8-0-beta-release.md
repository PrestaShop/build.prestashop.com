The public beta version of PrestaShop 8.0 is now ready for you to test!

![PrestaShop 8.0 Beta is available!](/assets/images/2022/08/8.0_beta_banner.png)

The maintainers team is very happy to announce today the release of the public beta version of PrestaShop 8.0. This version includes many new features, improvements and over 130 bug fixes.

The main new features for this version include an update to [Symfony 4.4](https://symfony.com/releases/4.4), compatibility with [PHP 8 and 8.1](https://www.php.net/), an enhanced experimental product page, and a new security page which allows shop administrators to manage user sessions and configure their password policy.

In addition, this version fixes [over 130 bugs](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A8.0.0+label%3ABug+-label%3ARegression+-label%3A8.0.x+-label%3Adevelop) found in previous releases, including:

* [In some circumstances, customers could be able to accidentally order an out-of-stock product, even if it was not allowed](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/10762).
* [An empty cart was being created whenever a customer signed in](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/9589).
* [Canonical links were missing on several pages](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/9503).
* [An error message was being logged every time an order was paid, even though there was no error](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/9866).
* [Visitors having placed an order weren't able to set up a customer account using the form at the bottom of the order confirmation page](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/14414).

PrestaShop 8 is also the project's first company-neutral release, meaning that it no longer includes commercial products and services built-in. You can find out more by reading [Beyond 1.7](/news/prestashop-beyond-1-7/) and watching the project's [public demo from November 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=128&v=jwOy3gx-MNs&feature=youtu.be).

This is the first major version of PrestaShop since 1.7.0 was released back in 2016. A significant cleanup has been performed in the codebase, which means several internal components have been slightly modified, and many older, deprecated components have been removed. This article in DevDocs describes the full list of what has been changed: [Changes in 8.0](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/8/modules/core-updates/8.0/).

**Remember, this beta version is pre-release software and it is highly possible that you will encounter some issues. Do not use it in your production shop!**

Also note that it is not possible to upgrade a shop from a beta to the final version using the upgrade module.

## Your feedback is important!

The public beta period is an extremely important phase to prepare for the upcoming release. During this period, we encourage everyone in the community to download this version and test how it behaves in their unique environment.

Here are some examples of how you can help:

* If you have access to a real shop, set up a copy of it in a separate environment and update it to PrestaShop 8 using the [upgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases). See if you notice any issues on the shop compared to your previous version. _(Note that there are some known issues during the upgrade process, but they shouldn't be blocking – [read more below](#known-issues))_.
* If you are a module or theme developer, check if they work well with this new version.
* If you notice any problem and you think it is caused by the new version, please [report it on GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new/choose).
* Don’t hesitate to [contribute to fixing bugs](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/8/contribute/contribute-pull-requests/) if you can!

**Your feedback on this beta is essential.** The more issues you report right now, the fewer bugs there will be on the final release, which means fewer patch versions and fewer problems on your (or your customer’s) online store.

**Please submit all your feedback by September 5, 2022.** If no new critical or major issue remains to be fixed by then, the first release candidate will be built and released a few days later.

If you have any questions about the version and its features, feel free to share them on [the PrestaShop project’s Slack](https://www.prestashop-project.org/slack/).

## Main new features & improvements

### Symfony 4.4 and PHP 8.1

PrestaShop 8 has been updated to [Symfony 4.4 LTS](https://symfony.com/releases/4.4), supported until November 2023. This release also brings compatibility with the most recent [PHP 8.1](https://www.php.net/releases/8.1/en.php), supported until November 2024.

### Improved product page

The experimental back office product page introduced in 1.7.8 has been significantly improved for this version. The page has been reorganized, combination management has been significantly improved, and bulk edition has been enhanced as well.

Please note that this feature is still experimental and deactivated by default because it doesn’t yet implement all the features found in the current product page (notably multishop features, among others). You can switch to the experimental page by activating it in _Advanced parameters > Experimental features_.

### Security page

A new Security page has been added in the _Advanced parameters_ section. It allows shop administrators to configure their desired password policy (complexity and length) for customers and employees. It also allows them to user sessions, and disconnect them remotely if needed.

### Modules & module management

The PrestaShop project is now free of commercial products and services, so it no longer includes the Addons Marketplace by default: it is now a [separate module](https://github.com/PrestaShopCorp/ps_mbo/releases) that can be installed independently, allowing you to install and update any module that you might have bought there.

The project’s [built-in modules](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/8/development/native-modules/) (also referred to as “native modules”) are now distributed thorugh a dedicated infrastructure, and can now be installed and updated directly from the Module Manager page.

PrestaShop 8 includes several additional built-in modules: Top-sellers block, Brand list, Cash on delivery, Products in the same category, Mail alerts, Google analytics, New Products, Specials block, Supplier list, Viewed products block, and Distribution API client. 

During the installation process, you can now choose which modules you want to install.
