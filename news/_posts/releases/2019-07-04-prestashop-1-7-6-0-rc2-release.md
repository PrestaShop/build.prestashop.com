Once again the PrestaShop community actively participated in the testing of the PrestaShop 1.7.6 Release Candidate.
Thanks to your involvement, 3 regressions were identified and fixed.

Our team is glad to announce PrestaShop 1.7.6.0 Release Candidate 2.
If no new regression is reported in the next days, we will make the final version of 1.7.6.0 available by the end of next week (28).


## Fixed in this Release Candidate 2
**Front Office:**
- [Issues with prices and currencies display in Dutch](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/14400) due to a bug in the method used to parse CLDR data.<br>If you experienced some missing decimals that was the cause. <br>We decided to take some time to verify everything is working well on the 40 main languages used on PrestaShop, and it does! <br>More improvements on currency management will be shipped in the 1.7.7 version.
- On Firefox browser, [duplicate arrows were displayed in the shopping cart product quantity field](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/14395).

**Back Office:**
- [Grid display error on the Add/Edit Customer page](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/14401) introduced by a previous PR to allow this page to extend in width.
- [Annotation driver settings improvement](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/14460) to ignore index.php files in Doctrine entities folder. Not a regression but a possible error case for modules using Doctrine

**Security:**
- There was an issue in the checkout process that could be used to select any delivery address existing in the db when placing an order, not only the ones owned by the customer. [The fix](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/14444) makes sure a customer can only use the addresses he owns and also prevents the address selection for an order to be done outside of the "confirm address" step.
