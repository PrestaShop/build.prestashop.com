After a few months dedicated to fixing all regressions found on the previous 1.7.6 versions, PrestaShop 1.7.6.3 is finally available! 

![1.7.6.3 is available!](/assets/images/2020/01/1763-banner.jpg)

This maintenance release fixes *16 issues* reported on versions 1.7.6.0, 1.7.6.1, and 1.7.6.2.

Obviously, you should upgrade your shop quickly in order to benefit from those fixes - and do not forget to backup before. ;-)

Reminder: the 1-Click Upgrade module’s latest version is v4.10.1 ([read here](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.10.1)), do not forget to upgrade it as well.

Since version 1.7.6.3 is a “patch” update to version 1.7.6.2, upgrading from any 1.7.6 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.6.x will work just as well with 1.7.6.3. Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.
