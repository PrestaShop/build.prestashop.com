PrestaShop 1.7.8.3 is now available. This maintenance release fixes 25 bugs and 1 security issue since the 1.7.8.2 release.

Note that this version introduces two backward-incompatible changes:
- The signature of  `PrestaShop\PrestaShop\Core\Translation\Storage\Extractor\LegacyModuleExtractor::__construct()` has been modified to allow excluding directories from the scan (see [the related Pull Request](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/26839) for details). This component is used by the Back Office's translation interface.
- Themes based on Classic might need to be adapted following [this change](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/26706) to fix the layout of the menu and search bar on tablet devices.

We suggest upgrading your store quickly to benefit from these bug fixes. Make sure to perform a full manual backup before, so you can roll back the upgrade if something goes wrong.

Reminder: the latest version of the 1-Click Upgrade module is v4.14.0, don't forget to upgrade it.

Since version 1.7.8.3 is a “patch” update to version 1.7.8.2, upgrading from any 1.7.8 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.8.x will work just as well with 1.7.8.2. Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.
