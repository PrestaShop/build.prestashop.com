## Important changes

Following [#15173](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/15173) we had to modify `CurrencyDataProviderInterface::findAll` and add an optional parameter to be able to fetch all currencies regardless of the current shop context. This doesn’t break any previous use of the method since the parameter is optional, but it requires to update any class that implemented that interface.

Following [#15139](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pull/15139), module translations are no longer attached to the currently active theme. If you want a different translation for each theme, you will have to edit the theme translations; this requires the specific wording to be physically present in the theme's templates or else it won't appear in the translation interface. Only theme translations are attached to a theme now, all other translations are now global.

Since version 1.7.6.1 is a “patch” update to version 1.7.6.0, upgrading from any 1.7.6 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.6.0 will work just as well with 1.7.6.1. Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.
