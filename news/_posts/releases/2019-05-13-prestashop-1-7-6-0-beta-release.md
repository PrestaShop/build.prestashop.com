The first Beta version for PrestaShop 1.7.6.0 is now ready for you to test!

![Prestashop 1.7.6.0 BETA Release](/assets/images/2019/05/1.7.6_beta_banner_May19.jpg)

We are really happy to announce that we are close to releasing 1.7.6.0.

Over 6 months in the making, PrestaShop 1.7.6.0 will be a huge release, our biggest one yet, with over 600 merged Pull Requests at the time of writing.

As they say, an image is worth a thousand words, so here's a graph to show how this beta compares with previous final releases in terms of number of contributions:

![Merged PRs by versions](/assets/images/2019/05/Merged_PRs_by_PrestaShop_Version.png)

As you can see, this beta release is about 25% bigger than 1.7.5 right now and roughly 3x as big as 1.7.3... and we are still one month away from final! 
The community has also been very present for 1.7.6. A whopping 110 people (from the PS team and the community at large) contributed code to create this version, including 60 new contributors.

This Beta release is a great opportunity for you to start working with it before we release a stable version. Go download and install this Beta version as a test store, either on your machine or your web hosting, then play with it – and give us your feedback! We need you to test this new version of PrestaShop.

If you find regressions compared to previous versions, please create an issue on [Github](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new?template%3Dbug_report.md) to help us to make it stable more quickly.

**Remember, this beta version is pre-release software. Do not use it on your production shop!**
