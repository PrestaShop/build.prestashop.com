Three weeks ago [we released PrestaShop 1.7.0.0 alpha 3](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-alpha-3-is-here/). Since then, and with the help of the community, we've been working on it to fix the bugs you've reported and to keep improving this new version. We're now **releasing PrestaShop 1.7.0.0 alpha 4 version**, so we can keep gathering feedback and make sure that the final and stable version will be the best it can be!



<div class="alert alert-important" role="alert">
While this alpha version is not ready for production stores, it is a great basis for us to get your feedbacks.

We’re are still working on some features and know some parts are broken. <a href="http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-alpha-3-is-here/#whats-in-progress">Check out the list in this article</a>.
</div>

Let’s insist on this: this is NOT the stable version of PS 1.7, and IT SHOULD NOT BE USED IN PRODUCTION. Do not create a new store with this alpha version, it is by definition not finished yet.

You SHOULD however install this alpha version as a test store, either on your machine or your web hosting, and play with it -- and give us your feedback!

The release date for the stable version is not yet set, so you have a few weeks and beta/RC versions ahead of you!

## How to give feedback

Have you found a bug? A curious behavior? An unexpected reaction? Let us know! [Create a ticket on the 1.7 Forge project](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue!default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1), and give us as much details as possible!

Please note that we are not looking for feedback on the overall technical or design choices: Symfony2, the new theming system, the back office design and other global aspects of 1.7 are pretty much set in stone. However, do let us know about bugs or possible improvements!

## What’s (still) in progress

Remember that this is alpha 4: a lot of things are not ready yet, or are ready but not yet available.

We tried to gather the most important ones, so you have a clear idea of what still needs to be implemented. All of this will eventually be fixed for the stable version -- and you can help with pull-requests on GitHub, and feedback of your tests!


### Core

* If your web hosting uses PHP-FPM, some links (and images) will not work.
* Multistore & Advanced Stock Management aren’t yet connected to the Create a Product Page.
* The header and navigation can vary (slightly) between pages.
* Employees permissions are not yet suited for the new navigation in place
* If a problem occurs while uploading a theme, we may not be able to tell you why currently :) In effect, errors and warnings are not fully set yet. And in any case, your 1.5-1.6 theme will NOT work with the new theme system.


### Front office

* Some links may be broken during your navigation on the shop


### Back office

* Some images are broken for now, some buttons and tab could behave in a weird way, and you might stumble on other weird artefacts. We know about this, and they will all be fixed in time.
* We’re still working on the responsiveness of the back-office, and 13” screens could particularly be affected.


### Modules page

* We’re improving the modules discovery page: better sorting, more information, reworked categories, etc.


### Content

* Interface copywriting is not final yet. Some parts need to be written, others are waiting for a rewrite and others are in proofreading.
* Default products are still the ones used in version 1.6. Version 1.7 should have a brand new set of products.
* Translations are on hold for now while we’re working on improving the system: the interface is only in English for now.


### Documentation

* Contextual help still displays 1.6 documentation as we’re updating it to 1.7. Expect it to be final during our RC period.
* Technical documentation for modules & themes should follow the same timeline.


## Final note!

So cheers for the second public glance at the brand new 1.7, made with <3 by our team and our wonderful Community. It’s not fully baked yet, but we’re very proud of the work done.
