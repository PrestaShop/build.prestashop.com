## Order page issue

Since version 1.7.7.7 is a “patch” update to version 1.7.7, upgrading from any 1.7.7 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.7.x will work just as well with 1.7.7.7. Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.
