This is the last step before releasing the final 1.7.6.0. It aims at making sure that all regressions found during the beta have been fixed, and that no new ones appeared. If no new regression is reported by July 1st, we will make the final version of 1.7.6.0 available.

Please note that it is not currently possible to perform an automatic upgrade from the Beta to the Release Candidate. Furthermore, it will not be possible to upgrade from this Release Candidate to the final release. If you perform an update of your test store to the RC version, you will need to rollback to your current version before being able to upgrade to the final 1.7.6.0.

Go download and install this RC version as a test store, either on your machine or your web hosting, then play with it â€“ and give us your feedback! We need YOU to test this new version of PrestaShop.

**Remember, this release candidate version is pre release software. Do not use it on your production shop!**
