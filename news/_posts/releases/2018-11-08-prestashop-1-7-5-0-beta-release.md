The first Beta version for PrestaShop 1.7.5.0 is now ready for you to test!

We are happy to announce that we are close to releasing 1.7.5.0. This minor version (in the SemVer meaning of the term) brings important new features and improvements to the 1.7 codebase, and we can’t wait to receive your feedback!

This Beta release is a great opportunity for you to start working with it before we release a stable version.
Go download and install this Beta version as a test store, either on your machine or your web hosting, then play with it – and [give us your feedback](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new/choose)! We need YOU to test this new version of PrestaShop.

**Remember, this beta version is pre release software. Do not use it on your production shop!**

  - The category block is no longer displayed after the first page

- Product page:
  - Specific prices can now be edited
  - The SEO section now displays a preview so that you can see how your page would be shown in Google results
  - When a product is taken offline, by default visitors will be redirected to the product’s main category, instead of a “Not found” page.

## The technical side

### Symfony migration

Newly migrated pages:
- Orders -> Delivery slips
- Orders -> Invoices
- Design -> Theme Catalog
- Design -> Positions
- Shipping -> Preferences
- Payment -> Payment Methods
- Payment -> Preferences
- International -> Localization -> Localization
- International -> Localization -> Geolocation
- International -> Translations (Page 1 out of 2)
- Shop Parameters -> Order Settings -> Order Settings
- Shop parameters > Traffic & SEO > SEO & URLs
- Advanced Parameters -> Database -> DB Backup
- Advanced Parameters > Webservice (hidden, because the page "Advanced Parameters > Webservice -> Add key" has not been migrated and it does not make UX sense to have only one of them)
- Advanced Parameters -> Logs
- Advanced parameters -> Email

Controllers:
- You can now link migrated controllers to legacy one to avoid breaking links thanks to the [`_legacy_link` routing property](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/architecture/migration-guide/controller-routing/#more-about-the-legacy-link-property)

- Improved compatibility with PHP 7.2
- The core theme is now built using Webpack 4 and includes jQuery 2.2.4
- Modules can now [declare modern (symfony-based) Back Office controllers](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/concepts/controllers/admin-controllers/) and use the UI kit
- Modules can now [declare and use Symfony commands](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/concepts/commands/)
- [Read about possible module regressions](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/core_updates/1.7.5/)
