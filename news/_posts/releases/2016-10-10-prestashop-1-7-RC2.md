Another step in the right direction towards a stable v1.7, this RC2 fixes a lot of stuff and enhances some more.

Again in this RC version, a good chunk of issues have been fixed and improved upon. It's getting better every day, thanks to our community! If you've been waiting to create a 1.7 theme or to upgrade your 1.6 modules, this is the right time!

## What's new in RC2?

In the two weeks since RC1, here is what landed in the codebase:

 * A late bonus: the theme system now supports a Parent/Child theme feature! [Read all about it](http://developers.prestashop.com/themes/smarty/parent-child-feature.html) on the [newly launched](http://build.prestashop.com/news/developer-documentation/) [tech documentation site](http://developers.prestashop.com/).
 * Native front modules can now be translated, and the module translation page has been updated.
 * Several new hooks were added.
 * Many many bugfixes, especially security ones!

See at the bottom of this article for the full list.


## What's not in RC2?

Hereâ€™s what we still intend to implement before we go stable:

* Fully mobile-ready front office -- still a handful of pages to be done.

NOTE: The RC2 was built a few days ago in order to be tested, and a last-minute test on hosts showed that a recent PR from a contributor updated our usage of OpenSSL, making it nearly impossible to install RC2 on hosts which do not support a version of Open SSL lower than 1.0.1. This will be fixed in time for RC3.


## How far are we from a stable 1.7 release?

We know many of you are waiting for The Answer: when is 1.7.0.0 going to be released? We know it is important to all professionals: merchants waiting to use the new features, agencies waiting to start selling 1.7 projects, developers and designers waiting to sell their creations on the Addons marketplace...

Our answer remains the same: we want to release a quality 1.7. We cannot give you a precise release date because we need to iron out the issues that we are receiving feedback about -- and we've received a LOT of feedback since RC0. [Keep them coming](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1)!

The team is working on fixing those issues, and we need you to start testing it in order to make sure it is stable enough for everyone. We want the whole community to be proud of 1.7, and to be able to sincerely promote it to the whole community.

But let's talk figures. Since RC1:

 * 245 Forge tickets were closed as "fixed":
   * 8 were blocking tickets.
   * 37 were critical tickets.
   * 163 were major tickets.
 
What's left to be done, so far:

 * 61 Forge tickets, among which:
   * 2 blocking tickets.
   * 7 critical tickets.
   * 52 major tickets.

The numbers are fluctuating since they all depend on YOUR feedback and our own QA tests, but we're getting close!


## What needs to be tested by you?

In RC0 and RC1, we said that the major things to test are the new theme system (because once it's stable, we can't revamp everything) and the module system (any hook missing?). This still holds true in RC2: try your hand at creating a theme or at upgrade a 1.6 module for 1.7 (a simple one at first). Have a look at the current state of the [PrestaShop 1.7 tech documentation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs), and of course, give us feedback, either positive or constructive, on your findings!

Again, as a module developer, if your usual hooks are missing, or if you feel the Modules system lacks something essential, let us know! [Read the documentation](https://github.com/PrestaShop/docs) (and [the Build article](http://build.prestashop.com/news/module-development-changes-in-17/)) and give us your feedback!

And, of course, let us know of any broken behavior or regression, especially in the pages that were completely rewritten: the Product page, and the Modules page.


## So, what's next?

The whole team is busy fixing everything that doesn't look right, in order to have a quality 1.7 release.

There will be a RC3, and possibly other RC versions until PrestaShop 1.7.0.0 is deemed stable enough for you -- and YOU can voice your opinion!

[Use the Forge](http://forge.prestashop.com/secure/CreateIssue%21default.jspa?selectedProjectId=11322&issuetype=1) to tell us what is blocking you, or possibly broken.
[Use GitHub](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/pulls) to fix the issues you have noticed.
Use the comments on this post to congratulate everyone ;)

Please note that we are not looking for feedback on the overall technical or design aspects: Symfony 2, the new theming system, the back office design and other global aspects of 1.7 (such as the UX decisions on the Product page and the Modules page) are pretty much set in stone.
However, do let us know about bugs or possible improvements to all the above aspects!


## Thank you to our contributors!

This wouldn't be a community project without pull-requests from our contributors:

@antho-girard, @ecomm360, @firstred, @ishcherbakov, @jherry, @kermes, @kioob, @kpodemski, @m03g, @maidmaid, @martinfojtik, @mcdado, @n-wouda, @phpmadman, @pkshetlie, @pranid, @prestamodule, @prestanesia, @turtl3, and @zuzul. Thank you all!
