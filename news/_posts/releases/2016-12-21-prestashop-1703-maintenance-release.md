PrestaShop 1.7.0.3 is now available. This maintenance release closes 28 of the most pressing issues reported since v1.7.

More than a year ago, we announced that we wanted to [release more regular and focused patch versions](http://build.prestashop.com/news/more-focused-patch-versions/) for 1.6 (and eventually 1.7), and that's exactly what we are currently doing: packing a few specific fixes (in order to limit regression potential) in regular releases. All this is done thanks in no small part to [our SemVer-like versioning](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/) and the 1-Click Upgrade module (update it if you haven't already done it for 1.7.0.2!).

We are therefore happy to deliver the third "patch" release of PrestaShop 1.7.0.0. Version 1.7 of PrestaShop continues to be explored by the community, and we keep working at fixing critical and major issues that were discovered since the release of v1.7.0.0, making regular fixes to the codebase. Prepare yourself to see more patch releases in the coming weeks while we review the feedback from the community!

Want to upgrade using the 1-Click Upgrade module? Make sure to upgrade the module itself first! This way you will have access to a new, 1.7-specific channel, which makes upgrading safer for merchants. Upgrading from 1.7.0.0 to 1.7.0.3 should be smooth as silk -- but do a safety backup anyway :)

Since version 1.7.0.3 is a "patch" update to version 1.7.0.0, upgrading from that version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.0.0 will work just as well with 1.7.0.3.
