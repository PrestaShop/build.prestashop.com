PrestaShop 1.7.2.1 is now available. This maintenance release fixes 25 issues reported on version 1.7.2.

Version 1.7.2.0, [released in July](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-2-0-available/), brought a lot of goodies, none the less being the new Stock Management feature. That new minor version was well received, and this patch version simply fixes a few kinks that were discovered, bringing further goodness and stability to the 1.7.2 branch.

Some of the most notable fixes are:

* Enhanced search performance on front office (and back office)
* Improved performance and search bar for stock management
* Better display of back office main menu and submenus
* Updated design for the modules page and other layouts improvements
* Improved translation page (yes, again ^^)

Contributors to this patch version, from both the Core team and the community at large: @aleeks, @azouz-jribi, @fatmabouchekoua, @jocel1, @maximebiloe, @molka, @nihco2, @prestamodule, and @soullivaneuh! Thank you!

Since version 1.7.2.1 is a "patch" update to version 1.7.2.0, upgrading from any 1.7.2 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.2.0 will work just as well with 1.7.2.1.<br/>
Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well, and those upgrading from older versions (1.6, 1.5, 1.4 or even older) should take their time and pay attention to their modules, their theme and their custom modifications!
