We are happy to announce PrestaShop 1.7.8.0 is officially available!

![1.7.8.0 is available!](/assets/images/2021/10/1780_banner_1200_628.jpg)

Each version of PrestaShop is getting bigger and bigger, with more and more regular contributors. We are very proud of having such a strong community working with us on a daily basis.

This new version brings [many features](https://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-7-8-0-beta-release/) that should please both merchants and developers. 

## New in 1.7.8.0

### Support for PHP 7.4

PrestaShop 1.7.8 introduces compatibility with PHP 7.4, which allows you to benefit from bug fixes and security patches from PHP until December 2023. 

Please be aware that PHP versions prior to 7.3 have reached end of life, and PHP 7.3 will only receive security fixes for one additional month, so we encourage you to update as soon as possible to stay safe. Find more information about PHP support [here](https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php) and about PrestaShop compatibility [here](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/basics/installation/system-requirements/).

  <div class="col-md-8">
Lazy loading is a technique that defers the loading of non-critical resources until the page load. We recommend all theme developers to use this technology to enhance their themes and to improve the merchant’s store performances.

### And many more features and improvements

### Notable fixes since RC1
The Release Candidate allowed a community member to detect [a bug](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/25959) that blocked the install process when running it from the CLI. This has been fixed for this final release.

## Changelog
1,492 pull requests have been merged since the beginning of the version development. Read the [Changelog](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/releases/tag/1.7.8.0) for more details.

PrestaShop 1.7.8.0 is also available through the 1-Click Upgrade module. 

## Upgrade 
Of course, we always recommended using the latest available version of the [1-Click Upgrade module](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade) when upgrading. However, if you are upgrading your shop to 1.7.8 from a version prior to **1.7.6**, make sure the module is updated to version 4.12.0 or later.

## Known issues
All the major regressions have been fixed, and [the remaining minor ones](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A1.7.8.1+is%3Aopen) are expected to be fixed in the upcoming 1.7.8.1 patch release.
