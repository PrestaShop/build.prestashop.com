You've all been very active in testing the previous Release Candidate - thank you very much for your feedback, both on the forums and on the Forge!

We heard your feeback and we've been hard at work fixing bugs and improving things.


## Release Candidate 5

You were waiting for it, here is the latest Release Candidate version! It's time to [download and test PrestaShop 1.6.1.0 RC5](https://www.prestashop.com/download/old/prestashop_1.6.1.0-rc5.zip).

As you understood, this version is mostly about the bugs you've reported. If you did report some bugs on the RC4, please test this new version and let us know how it behaves (smoothly, I'm sure).
You can [see all the new commits here].

For new comers, you'll find more about the previous versions and their novelties in our past articles: [PrestaShop 1.6.1.0 RC3](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1-6-1-0-rc3/) and [PrestaShop 1.6.1.0 RC4](http://build.prestashop.com/news/prestashop-1.6.1.0-rc4/).

With PrestaShop 1.6.1.0, the focus is chiefly on:

* **Performance** (on which you can read more here)
* **PDF templates** for invoices.
* **Back office orders**.
* **Price and tax calculations**.
* **Advanced EU Legal module**.

This is what you should concentrate on when testing this last RC version.

Other areas you might want to check:

* **Installer**.
* **1-click update module**.
* **Importer**, particularly in multilingual contexts.
* **Multistore**.
* **Cart rules** and **Catalog Price Rules**, along with the Ecotax.


## How to best test this RC5

Be reminded, **this is still a TEST VERSION**!

Do NOT update your real store with it. Version 1.6.1.0 RC5 is **not marked as production ready**, so if you do, do it at your own risk.

If you want to really test the thing, make a copy of your real store and update _that_ copy to 1.6.1.0 RC5. Then, do the whole process of adding a product, buying a product, installing a theme, changing settings, etc. You know the story!

**If you think youâ€™ve found a bug/issue**, you can let us know about it on [the Forge](http://forge.prestashop.com/), PrestaShop's bug-tracker. Make sure to present the steps to reproduce the bug/issue! [Read this page for more information on how to use the Forge](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/How+to+use+the+Forge+to+contribute+to+PrestaShop), especially the last part, "Best practices for writing an issue".

If you are a developer and you know how to fix an issue, open a Pull Request on [PrestaShop's GitHub page](https://github.com/prestashop/prestashop), on the 1.6 branch (NOT the master branch)! And remember to read these:

* [Contributing code to PrestaShop](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Contributing+code+to+PrestaShop)
* [How to write a commit message](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/How+to+write+a+commit+message)

Thanks again for your help!
