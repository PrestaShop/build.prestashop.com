The [PrestaShop 1.7.4.1 changelog](https://download.prestashop.com/download/releases/changelog_1.7.4.1.txt) is available.

Contributors to this patch version, from both the Core team and the community at large: @jocel1, @kpodemski, @lucasRolff, @marionf, @mickaelandrieu, @PierreRambaud, @prestamodule, @Quetzacoalt91, @rGaillard, @tomlev, and @toutantic! Thank you!

Since version 1.7.4.1 is a "patch" update to version 1.7.4.0, upgrading from the 1.7.4.0 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.4.0 will work just as well with 1.7.4.1.

Note that **we strongly recommend you to use the version 4.0 of the 1-click upgrade**, currently available as a beta on GitHub, instead of the version 3.0 available on the marketplace.
