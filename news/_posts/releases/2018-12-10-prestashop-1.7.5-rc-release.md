A few weeks after the beta, the first release candidate for PrestaShop 1.7.5.0 is now ready for you to test!

This is the last step before releasing the final 1.7.5.0. The aim of this version is to verify that all regressions found during the beta have been fixed, and that no new ones are reported by the community users. If nothing is reported by December 17, then the final version of 1.7.5.0 will be made available.

Please note that it is not currently possible to perform an automatic upgrade from the Beta to the Release Candidate. And, it will not be possible either to upgrade from this Release Candidate to the final release.

Go download and install this RC version as a test store, either on your machine or your web hosting, then play with it – and [give us your feedback](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/new/choose)! We need YOU to test this new version of PrestaShop.

**Remember, this release candidate version is pre release software. Do not use it on your production shop!**

## New in the release candidate

### Clear cache on module action

PrestaShop now clears the symfony cache when an action is performed on a module (install, uninstall, enable, ...)
This is necessary because modules can now use Symfony routing and services, so we need to clear the cache if we want
these services/routing to be updated.

### Changelog

44 pull requests from 14 developers have been merge since the beta release. Read the [Changelog](https://assets.prestashop2.com/en/system/files/ps_releases/changelog_1.7.5.0-rc.1.txt) for details.

A total of [130 issues have been fixed for the 1.7.5.0 milestone](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3AFixed+milestone%3A1.7.5.0+is%3Aclosed).

## The technical side

### Symfony migration

- International -> Translations (Page 1 out of 2)
- Shop Parameters -> Order Settings -> Order Settings
- Shop parameters > Traffic & SEO > SEO & URLs

Controllers:
- You can now link migrated controllers to legacy one to avoid breaking links thanks to the [`_legacy_link` routing property](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/architecture/migration-guide/controller-routing/#more-about-the-legacy-link-property)
