We're getting closer! With this new Release Candidate, we deliver a strong RC, which is closer than ever to our quality objectives.

A lot has been done to stabilize and enhance most of the details of the future version 1.7.0.0, and we expect you to be able to work with it as if it was a regular release. Are you feeling it? :)

## What's new in RC3?

In the two weeks since RC2, here is what landed in the codebase:

 * Many many bugfixes and performances improvements!

See at the bottom of this article for the full list.


## How far are we from a stable 1.7 release?

We know many of you are waiting for The Answer: when is 1.7.0.0 going to be released? We know it is important to all professionals: merchants waiting to use the new features, agencies waiting to start selling 1.7 projects, developers and designers waiting to sell their creations on the Addons marketplace...

Our answer remains the same: we want to release a quality 1.7. And we're getting there!


## So, what's next?

Granted no major issue arises from the QA tests around this RC3, well, let's just say that things could heat up sooner that later ;)

## Thank you to our contributors!

This wouldn't be a community project without pull-requests from our contributors:

@ecomm360, @prestamodule, @martinfojtik, @hubiktomas, @firstred, @true0r, @Nobodaddy. Thank you all!

This doesn't take into account all those who are active even without code changes: comments on PR, tickets on the Forge, translations on Crowdin, etc. PrestaShop is better thanks to you all!
