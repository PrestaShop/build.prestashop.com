After a Beta and a Release Candidate, the long awaited PrestaShop 1.7.5.0 has been released and is available for download.
As usual, you can upgrade with the Auto upgrade module. However, considering that the current period is usually critical for merchants sales, for sure, some might prefer to wait for a more appropriate time :-)

Top watchers:

- [#10638](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/10638) - Undefined $urls index in ajax rendered template
- [#9942](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/9942) - Add new referer error

- [#9697](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/issues/9697) - Unable to translate some strings in bank wire payment module 


### Symfony migration

Newly migrated pages:

- Orders -> Delivery slips
- Orders -> Invoices
- Design -> Theme Catalog
- Design -> Positions
- Shipping -> Preferences
- Payment -> Payment Methods
- Payment -> Preferences
- International -> Localization -> Localization
- International -> Translations (Page 1 out of 2)
- Shop Parameters -> Order Settings -> Order Settings
- Shop parameters > Traffic & SEO > SEO & URLs
- Advanced Parameters -> Database -> DB Backup
- Advanced Parameters > Webservice (hidden, because the page “Advanced Parameters > Webservice -> Add key” has not been migrated and it does not make UX sense to have only one of them)
- Advanced Parameters -> Logs
- Advanced parameters -> Email

Controllers:

- You can now link migrated controllers to legacy one to avoid breaking links thanks to the [_legacy_link routing property](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/architecture/migration-guide/controller-routing/#the-legacy-link-property).

The style of the migrated forms has been improved.


### Components and dependencies

- New [Grid component](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/development/components/grid/)
- Compatibility with Twig 2
- Improved compatibility with PHP 7.2
- The core theme is now built using Webpack 4 and includes jQuery 2.2.4
- Modules can now [declare modern (symfony-based) Back Office controllers](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/concepts/controllers/admin-controllers/) and use the UI kit
- Modules can now [declare and use Symfony commands](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/concepts/commands/)
- [Read about possible module regressions](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/core_updates/1.7.5/)


### New hooks

- action{GridId}GridQueryBuilderModifier
- action{GridId}GridDefinitionModifier
- action{GridId}GridDataModifier
- action{GridId}GridFilterFormModifier
- action{GridId}GridPresenterModifier
- actionFrontControllerSetVariables

The developer documentation includes a [description of hooks](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/modules/concepts/hooks/list-of-hooks/).


### Clear cache on module action

PrestaShop now clears the symfony cache when an action is performed on a module (install, uninstall, enable, …). This is necessary because modules can now use Symfony routing and services, so we need to clear the cache if we want these services/routing to be updated.

### Performance improvements

Lazy loading of the variables returned by the Cart / Order / Product presenters: if some informations are not used in your templates, they are not computed anymore.
