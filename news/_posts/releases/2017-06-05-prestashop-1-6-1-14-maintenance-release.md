As the version number indicates (as per [our SemVer-like versioning](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/)), this is the 14th patch release for PrestaShop 1.6.1.0.<br/>

As usual, if you are currently running promotions leading to high traffic on your website, we recommend that you wait for the promotion to end before attempting any upgrade and technical change to your store.

We hope you enjoy this new release!


### The changes

For a full list of changes, [see the list of pull requests merged into the 1.6.1.x branch in this milestone](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/milestone/21?closed=1)

Here are some of the most notable changes that this version brings:

* Fix taxes in credit slip
* Fix the refresh button of the stats bloc in the products list
* Add API_KEY field to display the map
* Fix html interpreted as text in carrier's wizard summary
* Fix non well formed numeric value
* ...and several other fixes.


The [PrestaShop 1.6.1.14 changelog](https://www.prestashop.com/en/system/files/ps_releases/changelog_1.6.1.14.txt) is available.

Since version 1.6.1.14 is a "patch" update to version 1.6.1.0, upgrading from that version will be as smooth as silk for everyone: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.6.1.0 will work just as well with 1.6.1.14.

This release had 13 contributors, both from PrestaShop and from the Community at large.

A huge "thank you!" to each of the 7 outside contributors, who gave their time and knowledge for the benefit of the whole PrestaShop community! [You too can contribute to the next version](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Contributing+code+to+PrestaShop)!

Let's go, [upgrade your store(s)](http://doc.prestashop.com/display/PS16/Updating+PrestaShop)! Upgrading from 1.6.1.0-1.6.1.14 is completely safe, upgrades from a standard 1.6.0.x version should work just as well, and those upgrading from version 1.5, 1.4 or even 1.3 should take their time and pay attention to their modules, their theme and their custom modifications!
