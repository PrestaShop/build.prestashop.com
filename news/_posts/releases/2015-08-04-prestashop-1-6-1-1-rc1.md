[As announced two weeks ago](http://build.prestashop.com/news/announcing-prestashop-1-6-1-1/), version 1.6.1.0 turned out great, but there were still a few bumps here and there. We have fixed the main issues that were reported: 140 pull requests were merged into this version!

We are now ready to start the testing phase with our Community! We want to give this version a solid testing phase: we are planning two weeks for feedback on the issues that were fixed in this 1.6.1.1 version. This testing phase starts today, with the availability of the first Release Candidate version, or RC1 for short.

We need you to make sure that this release is as bug free as possible. We need everyone to participate: merchants, developers, designers, translators, ... even customers! Test your modules, test your themes, make a test-upgrade on a copy of a real shop, etc.

Remember that 1.6.1.1 RC1 is a test version, and is therefore not yet deemed suitable for production use. Hence, do not upgrade your store just yet! Install the RC1 on your server (on as many server configurations as possible), or upgrade from a clone of your real store.
