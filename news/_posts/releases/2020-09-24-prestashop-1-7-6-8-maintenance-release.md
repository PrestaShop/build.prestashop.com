The ongoing work on security for PrestaShop software continues. We have identified and fixed new minor security issues, it has been decided to deliver a new maintenance release for 1.7.6.X branch.

Reminder: the 1-Click Upgrade module’s latest version is [v4.10.1](https://github.com/PrestaShop/autoupgrade/releases/tag/v4.10.1), don’t forget to upgrade it.

## Security fixes

4 security fixes have been included in this patch version:

Since version 1.7.6.8 is a "patch" update to version 1.7.6.7, upgrading from any 1.7.6 version will be easy: features will work better, and modules & themes which worked fine on 1.7.6.x will work the same with 1.7.6.8. Upgrades from a standard 1.7.x version should work just as well.
