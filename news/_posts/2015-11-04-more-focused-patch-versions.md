With the adoption of [SemVer](http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/)-like versioning, we know that patch version will only feature non-breaking changes, making it far safer to update to PrestaShop than ever before... and thus safer for us to release patch version more regularly.

We plan on adopting a new release process in order to give merchants and developers more predictable releases, with a higher level of transparency.

### The goals

The goals of this new release process are thus:

* Shorten the release cycle -- have more patch versions, with a more focused scope (10-15 issues each), making them easier to apply.
* Give more visibility to the contributing developers, and show that they are an essential part of PrestaShop.
* Improve the experience for PrestaShop contributors, both on GitHub and on the Forge -- without forgetting Crowdin or the forum.
* Give time to the PrestaShop ecosystem to catch up with the upcoming major/minor versions.


### The release process

In short: more regular and more focused patch versions.

Ever since we chose to follow a [SemVer-like versioning](http://http://build.prestashop.com/news/a-more-semantic-versioning-scheme/), PrestaShop's developers have wanted to manage the releases through a time-based model -- meaning that we want to make regular releases rather than trying to find a balance between "let's fix all the things!" and "merchants need a bug fix release as soon as possible!"

Now that we are ensuring that patch releases (which essentially retrocompatible bugfixes versions) are well-tested and more focused, we think we can provide our users with a more regular schedule. 

This allows us to perfect the maintenance phase of PrestaShop 1.6 for the coming months. More on that very soon!


### So, does that mean more updates are coming?

Yes! 

All this means that we want to stop waiting to have 200 code changes before we release a patch version. We know that both merchants and developers need bug fixed NOW. 

Since patch versions are built to be a safe upgrade for the current major or minor version, we think we owe it to you to release fixes more often -- probably every 2-3 weeks, with 10-15 issues.

We are confident this system of safe patch versions will increase your trust in upgrading PrestaShop.
