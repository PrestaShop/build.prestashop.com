      <description>Now that PrestaShop 8.0 is out, here is a focus on maintained branches of the PrestaShop project and what to expect.
Reminder: PrestaShop branching strategy In August 2015 PrestaShop adopted a new branching model for the project.
The model was refined over the years, for example with this page on the developer documentation about what bugs do qualify for a patch version or the Backward Compatibility Promise that defines what changes can be introduced in a version, but we can say the model has lived quite well as the project is still following it in 2023.</description>

      <description>It has been decided to deliver a new maintenance release for 1.7.8.x branch. Please note that this will be the last regular 1.7.8.x patch version, as the branch now enters security-only maintenance phase. Next regular patches will now target 8.0.x branch.
This release fixes some bugs and regressions as well as a security fix.
We suggest upgrading your shop quickly in order to benefit from these fixes. Of course, donâ€™t forget to backup before.</description>

project structure and processes helping finish and merge some PRs from the community multi-store features the future of core architecture And hopefully more discussions will come during the upcoming meetings.</description>

A significant cleanup has been performed in the codebase, with several internal components updated, modified or removed. PrestaShop 8 is also the projectâ€™s first company-neutral release, meaning that it no longer includes commercial products and services built-in.</description>
