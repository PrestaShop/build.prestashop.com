## Why this blog

This devblog is where the PrestaCrew communicates directly with the community. It's especially targeted at those who contribute (Core, translations, documentation, modules/themes, etc.)

This blog is about everything that has to do with PrestaShop development. The whole PrestaShop product team contributes: developers, product managers, designers, tech writers, etc. [We welcome your contributions](#contribute)!

We write about everything that happens to the PrestaShop software:

* New releases,
* Code activity in the past week,
* The upcoming improvement in the codebase, 
* Current and future architectures, 

...and all behavior changes that might affect you as a developer, a module/theme author, or simply as a Open Source fan :)

This devblog also hosts How-Tos on certain features, before they find their way in the Developer Guide or the Designer Guide.
