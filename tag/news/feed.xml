      <description>Today, GitHub Discussions are being enabled for the PrestaShop Project. This feature will provide a more organized and easily accessible way for community members to collaborate, ask questions, and share ideas.
What are GitHub Discussions? GitHub Discussions is a new feature in GitHub that provides a space for community members to discuss directly on the project’s GitHub page, similarly to traditional forum boards. This feature is a great way to ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate with other community members, and it has proven its value in other open-source communities.</description>

      <title>An update on the Symfony migration</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2022/introducing-horizontal-migration/</link>

      <description>In December 2015, a groundbreaking change in PrestaShop was announced: the introduction of the Symfony framework into the CMS. The goal was to gradually replace PrestaShop’s custom framework with Symfony, and switch its templating system from Smarty to Twig. This project was known as “The Symfony migration”. Looking back, we realize that referring to this project as a &amp;ldquo;migration&amp;rdquo; wasn&amp;rsquo;t really accurate at all.
Currently, migrating one page to Symfony involves several steps:</description>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2022/new-theme-announce/</guid>
      <description>For a long time, many community members have been pushing for a rework of the Classic front-office theme. The maintainer team is happy to announce that a new front-office theme is being built, and you can find it here.
Why such a decision? The PrestaShop community provided a lot of feedback and ideas, with suggestions like:
Upgrade Bootstrap to version 5, the latest LTS Rework the structure inside src directory, which was _dev before.</description>

      <title>PrestaShop beyond 1.7</title>

      <description>Five years ago, PrestaShop 1.7 was released to the world, introducing Symfony, the Classic theme and child theme features, interface improvements, and so much more. With each one of the eight minor versions that followed, 1.7 kept on growing both in features and stability. Its maturity is recognized by its success: with over 170,000 live shops detected at the time of writing, it’s the most popular PrestaShop version used in production shops on the web.</description>

      <title>Introducing TypeScript</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2021/introducing-typescript/</link>

      <description>Following a recent Architecture Decision Records (ADR) submission and a Proof of Concept (POC), the Core Maintainers team has decided to introduce TypeScript (TS) on the project.
Why TypeScript? During the last few years, the PrestaShop Project has been increasingly raising the code quality bar. To help maintainers ensure that quality keeps increasing, a number of automatic quality verification tools have been added to the CI pipeline:
ESLint analyzes the whole JavaScript codebase to ensure it follows our code style and find problems.</description>

      <title>Heads up: old development branches are going away</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2021/old-branches-are-going-away/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2021/old-branches-are-going-away/</guid>
      <description>The month of June is fast approaching, so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a late Spring clean!
On June 1st, 2021 we will delete all branches from our main repository that are no longer subject to new releases.
The affected branches are:
1.7.0.x 1.7.1.x 1.7.2.x 1.7.3.x 1.7.4.x 1.7.5.x 1.7.6.x Future branches will be deleted as well once they will become stale (e.g. 1.7.7.x will be deleted shortly after 1.7.8 is out).
Important note: Please be aware that this is a routine cleanup and has absolutely no impact on source code availability for previous versions.</description>

      <title>PrestaShop is now available on Composer</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2021/prestashop-available-composer/</link>

      <description>Released almost 10 years ago, Composer is the most popular package manager for the PHP ecosystem. PrestaShop has been using it since 1.7.0 to manage its dependencies, including all the native modules.
Today we are announcing the general availability of PrestaShop itself through Composer. Thanks to this, it is now possible to easily create a new PrestaShop project from the command line, like this:
composer create-project prestashop/prestashop Or, if you want to download a specific version instead of the latest release:</description>

      <title>Focusing on essential modules</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2021/focusing-on-essential-modules/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2021/focusing-on-essential-modules/</guid>
      <description>Over the years, the PrestaShop project became host and maintainer for a very large number of open source modules. Last year, over 160 of them were present in our GitHub organization. As you probably know already, maintaining them requires a lot of work, and the maintainer team&amp;rsquo;s resources are limited. Proof of this is that some of these modules have not been updated in years.
For this reason, the product team recently did a survey of almost 600 PrestaShop users to find out which modules were essential for their business and which ones they used the least.</description>

      <description>As announced here, the Core product team recently adopted a new working tool to gather feedback and prioritize features: Productboard. No more teasing, it is now time to have a look at how it will look and how we will all be able to handle it!
Productboard makes two things possible for the team:
On the one hand, having a dedicated internal interface to centralize all feedback, group them into topics, define features, and prioritize them.</description>

      <title>UX Guidelines for modules developers</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2019/ux-guidelines-for-modules-developers/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/2019/ux-guidelines-for-modules-developers/</guid>
      <description>With more than 4000 modules available on PrestaShop Addons marketplace, the diversity of features developed by modules developers or by the PrestaShop team is growing faster every day, making PrestaShop one of the most adaptive and versatile e-commerce solution.
UX Challenge Starting from this statement, one of the challenges PrestaShop has to address is consistency: with the variety of developers and modules comes the need to harmonise the interfaces in order to give our merchants the most fluid and consistent PrestaShop experience.</description>

      <title>Fighting against spamming - again!</title>

      <description>Remember the movie scene from Terminator when Arnold Swcharzenegger says &amp;ldquo;I’ll be back&amp;rdquo;? Well, this is pretty close to what spammers said last year after we prevented them from spamming our merchants’ contact forms (see article here).
A lot of PrestaShop users approached us these past few days because they were experiencing spam issues. Indeed, a stream of spammers is currently exploiting PrestaShop in order to flood people under a mass of undesired emails, generated by the creation of fake new customer accounts.</description>

      <description>Remember some Rocky fight scenes where Sylvester Stallone is beating the living daylights out of his opponents? Well, this is pretty close to the situation we are experiencing now, fighting against spammers.
We do hope you have not noticed because it would mean that this spamming wave spares you, how lucky! For the others, know that it happens because a stream of spammers is currently exploiting PrestaShop, among other platforms, to flood people under a mass of undesired emails.</description>

      <description>The Build devblog was started in March 2015 (and officially launched on April 3rd), as a way for the devteam to let the PrestaShop Community know about the things that we were planning. We wanted to communicate directly with the technical minds in the Community, and out of this want, this blog was born!
At first only filled with the Core Weekly reports, which were at the time published on the forums, the Build blog now shares news about the PrestaShop product, tools for contributing, and regular updates.</description>

      <description>As part of PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s product redesign, we decided to replace Font Awesome and start using our own icon pack. We&amp;rsquo;re sharing here the very first version of this new icon set, and we&amp;rsquo;ll keep you updated when it evolves.
Why these icons? We&amp;rsquo;re busy improving the global design experience in PrestaShop. It means giving a new identity to the software, and it starts with our own and unique icon set. Besides, we felt the world needed a Daft-Punk icon&amp;hellip;</description>
