      <description>The month of June is fast approaching, so it&amp;rsquo;s time for a late Spring clean!
On June 1st, 2021 we will delete all branches from our main repository that are no longer subject to new releases.
The affected branches are:
1.7.0.x 1.7.1.x 1.7.2.x 1.7.3.x 1.7.4.x 1.7.5.x 1.7.6.x Future branches will be deleted as well once they will become stale (e.g. 1.7.7.x will be deleted shortly after 1.7.8 is out).
Important note: Please be aware that this is a routine cleanup and has absolutely no impact on source code availability for previous versions.</description>
