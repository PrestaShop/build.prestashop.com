      <description>For a few months, quality has been a priority for PrestaShop: the QA team and I are proud to announce that we&amp;rsquo;re making great steps in improving the overall quality of the core project. Automatizing tests is a big part of this process: let’s see what we’re doing, why, and how! Note: this article is focused on the Core only, but that is just a small part of what the QA team is working on.</description>

      <description>According to the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), a bug is an &amp;ldquo;event that is not part of the standard operation of a service and causes an unplanned interruption or decrease the quality of service&amp;rdquo;. And it is everybody’s job to chase them all!
At the PrestaShop Quality Assurance team (aka QA), we browse issues on GitHub all day long. As we go about doing that, we often come across messages from people who are annoyed about a bug taking a long time to be fixed, and saying &amp;ldquo;this is a major issue, why is it still not fixed?</description>
