      <description>Here it is. The first public alpha of PrestaShop 9 is available. We decided it was time to share with you the first results of our work on PrestaShop 9.
Please note that this version is in the early stages of development. To achieve a stable release, we anticipate several months of further work. As we are prior to the feature-freeze phase, the features and content of PrestaShop 9 are subject to change.</description>
