Dear community,
Welcome to the first Core Monthly of 2023! 2022 was a fantastic year for the PrestaShop project, with a new major release, announcement of the upcoming new theme for PrestaShop, and significant changes to the project&amp;rsquo;s structure, which made it more open than it has ever been.</description>

      <description>In this Core Monthly, I will focus on a few important topics that are being worked on inside the project, the new product page, initiatives, new releases, and some great contributions from the community.
Dear developers,
Here it is! The first edition of the Core Monthly. I know through community feedback about the impact weekly summaries recently had, this is why it was decided to summarize the entire month in one article to make them more useful.</description>
