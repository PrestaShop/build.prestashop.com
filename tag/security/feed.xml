      <description>Attackers have found a way to use a security vulnerability to carry out arbitrary code execution in servers running PrestaShop websites. For details, please read the entire article.
What&amp;rsquo;s happening The maintainer team has been made aware that malicious actors are exploiting a combination of known and unknown security vulnerabilities to inject malicious code in PrestaShop websites, allowing them to execute arbitrary instructions, and potentially steal customer&amp;rsquo;s payment information.
While investigating this attack, we found a previously unknown vulnerability chain that we are fixing.</description>

      <title>Bug Bounty Program, the retrospective</title>

      <description>For several months, we experimented a Bug Bounty Program with the YesWeHack platform. Here is a retrospective, explaining why we did it, and what happened during this period.
Private program The security of software cannot be assessed unless it is tested by a lot of hunters.
PrestaShop relies on a lot of dependencies, with hundreds of thousands lines of code, and this has been true since the very first versions.</description>

      <description>Protecting the business, data and privacy of PrestaShop&amp;rsquo;s users is one of our top priorities. We build our software with this goal in mind. That&amp;rsquo;s why we decided to put our security to the test. To encourage the security community to help us, today we are announcing our first bug bounty program!
Why this program Bug bounties are used by many leading companies to improve the security of their products. These programs provide an incentive for researchers to responsibly disclose software bugs and allow security teams to leverage the external community to help keep users safe.</description>

      <description>The ongoing work on security for PrestaShop software continues. We have identified and fixed new minor security issues and since we don&amp;rsquo;t expect PrestaShop 1.7.7.0 final to be released before a few weeks, it has been decided to deliver a new maintenance release for 1.7.6.X branch.
Similarly to 1.7.6.5, this maintenance release fixes not only regressions found on versions 1.7.6.0 to 1.7.6.5, but also a few security issues from 1.5, 1.</description>

      <description>Once again, open source CMSs Security leads shared knowledge together last February at an event organized by Google in Munich.
Lightning talks &amp;amp; Security technologies After spending the first evening with stakeholders and meeting the newcomers over a few beers, the attendees and I spent two days at Google&amp;rsquo;s Munich office and Information Security Hub (ISH) to talk about what we have achieved since last year and about what&amp;rsquo;s coming. And of course we learned a lot about each other.</description>

      <description>A few months ago, the PrestaShop core team has decided to make a forthright patch release process and deliver patch versions on a more regular basis, every time it’s needed. So here we are, 6 weeks after the release of 1.7.6.4, PrestaShop 1.7.6.5 is now available!
This maintenance release is a bit special as it does not only fix regressions found on version 1.7.6.0 to 1.7.6.4, but it also has put a focus on fixing many security issues, from 1.</description>

We suggest upgrading your shop quickly to benefit from these fixes. Of course, don’t forget to backup before.</description>

      <title>Security issue with PHPUnit, post-incident analysis</title>
      <link>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/phpunit-security-issue-post-analysis/</link>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/phpunit-security-issue-post-analysis/</guid>
      <description>Early January, we encountered a security issue with PHPUnit in some modules that allowed attackers to perform arbitrary code execution without authorization through the PHPUnit dependency. This vulnerability was discovered through a merchant whose shops were compromised.
Background At PrestaShop, we use an automated system to build packages for native modules and make them available through the Addons Marketplace API. This process uses Composer to install dependencies before creating the zip package.</description>

      <guid>https://build.prestashop-project.org/news/critical-security-vulnerability-in-prestashop-modules/</guid>
      <description>Attackers are using a vulnerability in a popular dependency used by modules to take control of PrestaShop sites. For details, please read the entire article.
What’s happening It has come to our attention that attackers are exploiting a vulnerability in PHPUnit to perform arbitrary code execution in servers running PrestaShop websites. The issue is fixed in PHPUnit 7.5.19 and 8.5.1. To our knowledge, all previous versions are vulnerable, at least for certain server configurations.</description>

      <description>PrestaShop 1.7.5.2 and 1.6.1.24 are now available. These versions fix a security issue for both 1.7.5.x and 1.6.1.x. For the details, please read below:
These two security updates address a validation issue on the customer registration form, which is currently being exploited by spammers who were entering URLs as customer name.
This update mitigates the problem by preventing attackers to use URLs as names. However, as we discussed before, the best protection against this kind of attack still is to add a CAPTCHA module on your shop.</description>

      <description>PrestaShop and other open source CMSs are working together to improve the security of websites.
Winter is not coming, it is already here! As a member of the Open Source community, a few weeks ago PrestaShop went to the coldest place on earth, even colder than Antarctica, even colder than Siberia: YES, we went to Chicago on January 30th 2019 (-40º C)
You’re all asking: &amp;ldquo;But what can we do on January in Chicago except eating Deep Dish pizza and drinking India Pale Ale?</description>

These two security updates fix issues on the file manager integrated in the text editor component in the Back Office. By exploiting a combination of security vunerabilities, an authenticated user in the Back Office could upload a malicious file that would then allow him or her to execute arbitrary code on the server.</description>

      <description>PrestaShop 1.7.2.5 is now available. This is a security release for all previous versions of PrestaShop 1.7.
Security researchers recently reported the Core team of two vulnerabilities affecting the Back Office, one of them critical.
Issue 1 - Critical Parameter unserializing could be exploited by an authentified attacker in order to execute arbitrary code on the server, with the same user level as the PHP binary.
This issue was introduced by a PR merged in September 2016.</description>
