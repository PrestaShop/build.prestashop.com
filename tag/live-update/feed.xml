Demos that you don&amp;rsquo;t want to miss! Safe to say, this was one of the best, if not the best, live updates we ever held. During February&amp;rsquo;s event, we had a chance to see one of the most popular PrestaShop community projects. Integration between PrestaShop and Vue Storefront created by BinShops.</description>
